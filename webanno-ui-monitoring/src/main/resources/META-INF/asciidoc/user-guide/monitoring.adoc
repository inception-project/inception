== Monitoring

NOTE: This functionality is only available to *project managers* (managers of existing projects), 
      *curators*, and *administrators*. Curators and project managers only see projects in which
      they hold the respective roles.

As an administrator, you are able to observe the progress and document status of projects you are 
responsible for. Moreover, you are able to see the time of the last login of every user and observe the agreement between the annotators.
After clicking on *Monitoring* in the main menu, the following page is displayed:

In the right frame, the overall progress of all projects is displayed.
In the left frame one sees all projects, that one has an administrator role in.  
By clicking on one of the projects on the left, it may be selected and the following view is opened:

The percentual progress out of the workload for individual annotators may be viewed as well as the number of finished documents.

[[sect_monitoring_status]]

Below the document overview, a measuring for the inter-annotator-agreement can be selected by opening the *Measure* dropdown menu. Three different units of measurement are possible: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa[Cohen's kappa] as implemented in
DKPro Statistics, link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleiss%27_kappa[Fleiss' kappa] and link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krippendorff%27s_alpha[Krippendorff's alpha].
Below the *Measure* dropdown menu, an export format can be chosen. Currently, only link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values[CSV] format is possible.

Above the *Measure* dropdown menu, the *Feature* box allows the selection of layers for which an agreement shall be computed. Double-clicking on a layer starts the computation of the agreement and an outline is shown to the left side of the box:

The following table explains the different symbols which explain the status of a document for a user
and the described task.

.Document Status
|===
| Symbol | Meaning

| image:icon_new.png[]
| Annotation has not started yet

| image:icon_locked.png[]
| Document not available to user

| image:icon_annotation_in_progress.png[]
| Annotation is in progress

| image:icon_done.png[]
| Annotation is complete

| image:icon_curation_in_progress.png[]
| Curation is in progress
|===

You can also alter the document status of annotators. By clicking on the symbols you can change between *Done* and *In Progress*.
You can also alter between *New* and *Locked* status. 
The second column of the document status frame displays the status of the curation. 

As there is only one curator for one document, curation is not divided into individual curators.

Scrolling down, two further frames become visible. The left one, named *Layer*, allows you to chose a layer in which pairwise link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa[kappa agreement] between annotators will be calculated.
