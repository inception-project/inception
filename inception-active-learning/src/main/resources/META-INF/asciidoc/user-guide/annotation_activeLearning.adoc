== Active Learning

Active learning is a family of methods which seeks to optimize the learning rate of classification algorithms by  soliciting labels from a human user in a particular order. This means that recommenders should be able to make better suggestions with fewer user interactions, allowing the user to perform quicker and more accurate annotations. Note that Active Learning only works if there are recommenders and if these recommenders actually generate recommendations which are usually shown as grey bubbles over the text.

Open the Active Learning sidebar on the left of the screen. You can choose from a list of all layers for which recommenders have been configured and then start an active learning session on that layer.

The system will start showing recommendations, one by one, according to the
<<developer-guide.adoc#sect_activeLearning_uncertaintySampling,uncertainty sampling>> learning strategy. For every recommendation, it shows the related text, the
suggested annotation, the confidence score and a delta that represents the difference between the
given score and the closest score calculated for another suggestion made by the same recommender to that text. Additionally, there is a field which shows the suggested label and which allows changing that label - i.e. to correct the suggestion provided by the system. The recommendation is also highlighted in the central annotation editor.

One can now _Annotate_, _Reject_ or _Skip_ this recommendation in the Active Learning sidebar:

When using the _Annotate_, _Reject_ or _Skip_ buttons, the system automatically jumps to the next suggestion for the user to inspect. However, at times it may be necessary to go back to a recently inspected suggestion in order to review it. The *History* panel shows the 50 most recent actions. Clicking on the text of an item loads it in the main annotation editor. It is also possible to delete items from the history, e.g. wrongly rejected items.

The history panel displays whether a given suggestion was accepted, corrected or rejected, but this information can only be indicative. It represents a snapshot of the moment where the user made the choice. As the recommender is continuously updated by the system, the suggestions constantly change. It may happen that a suggestion which is shown as _rejected_ in the sidebar is at a later time not even generated anymore by the recommender. Thus, deleting an item from the history will not always cause the suggestion from which it was generated to reappear. Resetting a document also clears the Active Learning history.

{product-name} allows the user to create annotations as usual in the main annotation editor panel, even when in an Active Learning session. However, there is only a limited interaction with actions performed in the main annotation editor. If a suggestion is accepted or rejected in the main annotation editor, this is recorded in the history. However, if a user manually creates an annotation which causes a suggestion to disappear by overlapping with it, the history does not record this as a correction. For example, if the system generates a suggestion for `Paul.` (including the final sentence punctuation) but the user manually creates an annotation only for `Paul` (without the punctuation), the system does not recognize it as a correction.

Accepting/correcting, rejecting and skipping a suggestion in the sidebar cause the main annotation editor to move to the next suggestion. However, when a suggestion is accepted or rejected via the main editor, the generated annotation is opened in the annotation detail editor panel on the right side and the editor does not move to the next suggestion. For actions made in the main editor, it is assumed that the user may want to perform additional actions (e.g. set features, create more annotations in the vicinity) - jumping to the next suggestion would interfere with such intentions. That said, the next suggestion is loaded in the active learning sidebar and the user can jump to it by clicking on the suggestion text in the sidebar.

When removing an accepted/corrected item from the history and the annotation which was generated from this item is still present (i.e. it has not been deleted by other means), the user is asked whether the associated annotation should also be deleted.

Suggestions that are skipped disappear at first. However, once all other suggestions have been processed, the system asks whether the skipped suggestions should now be reviewed. Accepting will remove all skipped items from the history (even those that might no longer be visible in the history because of its on-screen size limit).
