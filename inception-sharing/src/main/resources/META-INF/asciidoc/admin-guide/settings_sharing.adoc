=== Invite Links Settings

You can enable invite links for your {product-name} instance. This will allow project managers to generate invite links for their project which will expire automatically in one year but can also be deleted or regenerated by the manager. Any user of your instance can use this invite link to access the project. She will automatically be added to the project with annotator rights when following it. However, the user needs to have a valid user account for this.
