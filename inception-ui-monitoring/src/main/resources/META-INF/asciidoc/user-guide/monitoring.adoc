= Monitoring

NOTE: This functionality is only available to *curators* and *managers*.

This page allows to observe the progress and document status of projects you are responsible for. 
Moreover, you are able to see the time of the last login of every user. After clicking on *Monitoring* in the main menu, 
the following page is displayed:

In the right frame, the overall progress of all projects is displayed.
In the left frame you can see all projects that you are allowed to curate or manage.  
By clicking on one of the projects on the left, it may be selected and the following view is opened:

The percental progress out of the workload for individual annotators may be viewed as well as the number of finished documents.
The table below these statistics shows the document status of each document for each user via a symbol.

The following table explains the different possible symbols:

.Document Status
|===
| Symbol | Meaning

| image:icon_new.png[]
| Annotation has not started yet

| image:icon_locked.png[]
| Document not available to user

| image:icon_annotation_in_progress.png[]
| Annotation is in progress

| image:icon_done.png[]
| Annotation is complete

| image:icon_curation_in_progress.png[]
| Curation is in progress
|===

You can also alter the document status of annotators. By clicking on the symbols you can change between *Done* and *In Progress*.
You can also alter between *New* and *Locked* status. 
The second column of the document status frame displays the status of the curation. 

As there is only one curator for one document, curation is not divided into individual curators.
