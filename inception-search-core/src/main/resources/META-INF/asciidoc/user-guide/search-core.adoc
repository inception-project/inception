== Search

The search module allows to search for words, passages and annotations made in the 
documents of a given project. Currently, the default search is provided by *Mtas*
(Multi Tier Annotation Search), a Lucene/Solr based search and indexing mechanism developed by
Meertens Institut (https://meertensinstituut.github.io/mtas).

To perform a search, access the search sidebar located at the left of the screen, write a query and
press the *Search* button. The results are shown below the query in a KWIC (keyword in context)
style grouped by document. Clicking on a result will open the match in the main annotation editor.

The search only considers documents in the current project and only matches annotations made by
the current user.

NOTE: Very long annotations and tokens (longer than several thousand characters) are not indexed and 
       cannot be found by the search.

Clicking on the search settings button (cog wheel) shows additional options:

* **Current document only** limits the search to the document shown in the main annotation editor.
  When switching to another document, the result list does not change automatically - the search
  button needs to be pressed again in order to show results from the new document.
* **Rebuild index** may help fixing search issues (e.g. no or only partial results), in particular
  after upgrading to a new version of {product-name}. Note that this process may take quite some
  time depending on the number of documents in the project.
* **Grouping by** allows to group the search results by feature values of the selected annotation
  feature. By default the search results will be grouped by document title if no layer and no
  feature is selected.

=== Creating/Deleting Annotations for Search Results

The user can also use the search to create and/or delete annotations for a set of selected search
results.

This means that annotations will be created/deleted at the token offsets of the selected search
results.
Search results can be selected via the checkbox on the left. Per default all search
results are selected. If a result originates from a document which the user has already marked as
*finished*, there is no checkbox since such documents cannot be modified anyway.

The currently selected annotation in the annotation editor serves as template for the annotations
that are to be created/deleted. Note that selecting an annotation first is necessary for
creating/deleting annotations in this way.

Clicking on the create settings button (cog wheel) shows additional options:

* **Override existing** will override an existing annotation of the same layer at a target location.
    If this option is disabled, annotations of the same layer will be stacked if stacking is enabled
    for this layer. Otherwise no annotation will be created.

Clicking on the delete settings button (cog wheel) shows additional options:

* **Delete only matching feature values** will only delete annotations at search results that
    exactly match the currently selected annotation including all feature values. If this option is
    disabled all annotations with the same layer as the currently selected annotation will be
    deleted regardless of their feature values.
