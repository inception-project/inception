== Search

The INCEpTION search module allows to search for words, passages and annotations made in the 
documents of a given project. For doing a search, the user must access the search sidebar located 
in the left of the screen, write a query and press the *Search* button. The results will be shown 
below the query, grouped by the document where they come from. Every result is shown in KWIC 
(keyword in context) style, i.e., surrounded by a left and right context to facilitate its 
identification. Additionally, results are highlighted in the text of the annotation editor area.
Using the *Close* button, the results can be cleared.

Clicking on a result will make the central main editor automatically jump to the position of that
result inside the original document. Only documents contained in the current project will be
retrieved by a given search.

INCEpTION allows the configuration of different search providers. Currently, the default search 
is provided by *Mtas* (Multi Tier Annotation Search), a Lucene/Solr based search and indexing 
mechanism developed by Meertens Institut (https://meertensinstituut.github.io/mtas).
