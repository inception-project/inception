== Project overview

After logging in to {product-name}, the first thing you see is the project overview. Here, you can
see all the projects to which you have access. For every project, the roles you have are shown.

Users with the role *project creator* can conveniently *create new projects* or
*import project archives* on this page.

When uploading projects via this page, no permissions for the project are imported! If the 
current instance has users with the same name as those who originally worked on the
import project, the manager can add these users to the project and they can access their annotations.
Otherwise, only the imported source documents are accessible. Users with the role *administrator*
who wish to import projects with all permissions and optionally create missing users have to do this
through the <<sect_projects>> which can be access through the *Administration* link in the menu bar.
