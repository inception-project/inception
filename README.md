# INCEpTION

Build annotated text corpora with your own annotation scheme, ground them in your own ontology, and
let a recommender that learns as you go do the repetitive part.

- **Annotate against your ontology.** Load RDF, OWL, OBO, SKOS or Turtle, or query a remote SPARQL
  endpoint live. Profiles for Wikidata, SNOMED CT, the Gene Ontology, the Human Phenotype Ontology
  and GND.
- **Stack as many layers as your scheme needs.** Entities, relations, coreference, syntax, frames and
  document labels over the same text, with typed features and slots. Define it all in the browser.
- **Get suggestions that improve while you work.** Recommenders train on what you have annotated so
  far; active learning asks about the cases they are least sure of. Nothing is stored until you
  accept it.
- **Know your annotations are good.** Curate several annotators into a gold standard, measure
  inter-annotator agreement, and chart what you collected in the Explorer.
- **Runs where you need it to run.** A desktop installer for one person, or a server deployment for
  a whole institution — on your own hardware, with your own single sign-on.
- **Drive it from your own code.** REST API, webhooks, and your own models as
  [external recommenders](https://github.com/inception-project/inception-external-recommender).
- **Speaks your field's formats.** Imports plain text, PDF, HTML and TEI; exports UIMA CAS XMI/JSON
  with custom layers intact, or CoNLL-U.

More detail, screenshots and example projects are on the
**[INCEpTION website](https://inception-project.github.io/)**.

## Getting started

The best way to get started is to
watch [our tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ely8eBKqiSI&list=PL5Hz5pttaj96SlXHGRZf8KzlYvpVHIoL-),
working through
the [Getting Started Guide](https://inception-project.github.io/documentation/latest/user-guide#sect_core_funct) and
playing with INCEpTION on the [demo server](https://morbo.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/demo).
