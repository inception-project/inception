# Builds the Windows MSI on GitHub Actions and downloads it.
#
# The MSI cannot be built locally, so this dispatches the dist-win workflow on
# the release tag, waits for it, and unpacks the artifact where the other
# release steps expect it - so `release.sh status` and `release.sh draft` then
# treat it like a locally built artifact.
#
# Re-runnable: if a successful run for the tag already exists, it downloads from
# that instead of building again. Use --rebuild to force a new run.
#
# Usage: release-windows.sh [--rebuild] [--dry-run]
