== Concept Linking

Concept Linking is the task of identifying concept mentions in the text and linking them to their
corresponding concept in a knowledge base.
Use cases of Concept Linking are commonly found in the area of biomedical text mining, e.g.
to facilitate understanding of unexplained terminology or abbreviations in scientific literature by linking
biological entities.

=== Interactive Concept Linking
Interactive Concept Linking allows users to manually link concept mentions to a KB. It is especially
useful in situations where there is no substantial training data available from the start,
i.e. when no previous linkings have been made. In this case, each concept mention is disambiguated
with the help of heuristical rules.

When the user wants to link a mention, he marks it and starts typing the name of the concept.
A ranked list of candidates is then displayed in the form of a drop-down menu.
In order to make the disambiguation process easier, descriptions are shown for each candidate.

The suggestions are updated every time it receives new input.

=== Automated Concept Suggestions

The Named Entity Linker (NEL) displays three highest-ranked candidates as suggestions boxes
over each mention annotated as Named Entity.
The user can accept, reject or ignore these suggestions.
If a suggestion is rejected, it is not showed again.
It is possible to combine the NEL with the existing Named Entity Recommenders for the NE type,
which makes the annotation process even faster.
The recommender needs to be set up in the <<sect_projects_recommendation, Project Settings>>.
