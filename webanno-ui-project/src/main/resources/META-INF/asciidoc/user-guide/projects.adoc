[[sect_projects]]
= Projects

NOTE: This functionality is only available to *managers* of existing projects, 
      *project creators* (users with the ability to create new projects), and *administrators*.
      Project managers only see projects in which they hold the respective roles. Project creators
      only see projects in which they hold the project manager role.

This is the place to specify/edit annotation projects.  
You can either select one of the existing projects for editing, or click *Create Project* to add a project.

Although correction and automation projects function similarly, the management differs after the creation of the document. For further description, look at the corresponding chapters <<sect_automation>> and <<sect_correction>>.

Click on *Create Project* to create a new project.

After doing so, a new pane is displayed, where you can name and describe your new project. It is also important to chose the kind of project you want to create. You have the choice between annotation, automation, and correction.
Please do not forget to save.
