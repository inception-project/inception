== User Management

NOTE: This functionality is only available to *administrators*.

After selecting this functionality, you are displayed a frame which shows all users. By selecting a user, a frame is displayed on the right.

Now you may change his role or password, specify  an e-mail address or dis- or enable his account by placing the tick.

NOTE: Disabling an account prevents the user from logging in. The user remains associated with any
      projects and remains visible in on the <<sect_monitoring>> page.

To create a new user, click on *Create* in the left frame. This will display a similar frame as the one described in the last paragraph. Here you have to give a login-name to the new user.

In both cases, do not forget to save your changes by pressing the *Save* button.
