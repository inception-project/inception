              This telemetry collector helps the developer team of
              <wicket:message key="product.name" />
              discover the number of installations and the size of the user base. These are
              important indicators for the success of the product and are e.g. included in reports
              to funders. Please support the future development of
              <wicket:message key="product.name" />
              by submitting these <b>anonymous usage statistics</b> to the developers at UKP Lab,
              Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany.
            </p>
            <p>
              The anonymous usage statistics are sent to our server every time the application is
              started.
