[[sect_curation]]
= Curation

NOTE: This functionality is only available to *curators*.

When navigating to the *Curation Page*, the procedure for opening projects and documents is the same as in <<sect_annotation>>. The navigation within the document is also equivalent to <<sect_annotation>>.

In the left frame of the window, named *Sentences*, an overview of the chosen document is displayed. Sentences are represented by their number inside the document. Sentences containing a disagreement between annotators are colored in red. Click on a sentence in order to select it and to to edit it in the central part of the page.

The center part of the annotation page is divided into the *Annotation* pane which is a full-scale
annotation editor and contains the final data from the curation step. Below it are multiple read-only
panes containing the annotations from individual annotators. Clicking on an annotation in any of the
annotator's panes transfers the respective annotation to the *Annotation* pane.

When a document is opened for the first time in the curation page, the application analyzes agreements
and disagreemens between annotators. All annotations on which all annotators agree are automatically
copied to the *Annotation* pane. Any annotations on which the annotators disagree are skipped.

The annotator's panes are color-coded according to their relation with the contents of the *Annotation*
pane and according to the agreement status. If the annotations were the same, they are marked *grey* in the lower panes. If the annotations are disparate, the markings are dark blue in the lower frames. By default, they are not taken into the merged file. If you choose one annotation to be right by clicking on it, the chosen annotation will turn green in the frame of the corresponding annotator. Also, the annotation will say *USE* next to the classification. 

Note that the *Annotation* pane is not color-coded. It uses whatever coloring strategy is configured
in the *Settings* dialog.

The annotations which were not chosen to be in the merged file are marked dark blue. The annotations which were wrongly classified are marked in red.

.Explanation of the annotation colors in the annotator's panes (lower panes)
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Grey
| all annotators agree

| Blue 
| disagreement requiring curation; annotators disagree and there is no corresponding annotation in the upper *Annotation* pane yet

| Green 
| accepted; matches the corresponding annotation in the upper *Annotation* pane

| Red 
| rejected; different to the corresponding annotation in the upper *Annotation* pane

.Merging strategies
By default, the merging strategy only considers annotations if all annotators made the same 
annotation at the same location (i.e. complete and agreeing annotations) - i.e. it considers any 
annotations not provided by all annotators as a disagreement between the annotators.

However, there are situations where it is desirable to merge annotations from all annotators, even
if some did not provide it. For example, if your project has two annotators, one working on POS
tagging and another working on lemmatization, then as a curator, you might simply want to merge the
annotators from the two. This can be done by using the **Re-merge** action and activating the
checkbox **Merge incomplete annotations**. This will re-merge the current document (i.e. discard
the entire state of curation and merge from scratch).

.Anonymized curation
By default, the curator can see the annotators names on the curation page. However, in some cases,
it may not be desirable for the curator to see the names. In this case, enable the option
*Anonymous curation* in the project detail settings. Users with the curator role will then only
see an anonymous label like *Anonymized annotator 1* instead of the annotator names. Users who are
project managers can still see the annotator names.

NOTE: The order of the annotators is not randomized - only the names are removed from the UI. Only 
      annotators who have marked their documents as *finished* are shown. Thus, which annotator recieves 
      which number may changed depending on documents being marked as finished or put back into progress.
