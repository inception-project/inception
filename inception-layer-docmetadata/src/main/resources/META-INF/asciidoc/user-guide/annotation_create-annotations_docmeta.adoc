= Document metadata

Before being able to configure document-level annotations, you need to define an annotation layer of 
type *Document metadata* on the project *Settings*, *Layers* tab. For this:

* Go to *Settings -> Layers* and click the *Create* button
* Enter a name for the annotation layer (e.g. `Author`) and set its type to *Document metadata*
* Click *Save*
* On the right side of the page, you can now configure features for this annotation layer by clicking *Create*
* Again, choose a name and type for the feature e.g. `name` of type *Primitive: String*
* Click *Save*

On the annotation page, you can now:

* Open the **Document Metadata sidebar** (the tags icon) and
* Choose the newly created annotation layer in the dropdown.
* Clicking the plus sign will add a new annotation whose feature you can fill in.

NOTE: This is an experimental feature not recommended for serious use. However, you can try it out
      and enable it by adding `documentmetadata.enabled=true` to the `settings.properties` file. In 
      particular, curation of document metadata annotations is not possible and they are not supported
      by the TSV format. They can be im-/exported via XMI or Binary CAS though.
