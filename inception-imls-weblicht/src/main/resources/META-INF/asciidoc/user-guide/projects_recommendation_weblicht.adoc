== WebLicht

The WebLicht recommender allows you to use CLARIN WebLicht services to generate annotation
recommendations. In order to do so, first need to obtain an API key link:https://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/WaaS/apikey[here].

After making the basic settings and entering the API key, **Save** the recommender. Doing so allows
you to attach a processing chain definition file. With out such a file, the recommender will not
work. We will provide some example settings here to go along with the example processing chain that
we will be building below:

* **Layer**: Named entity
* **Feature**: value
* **Tool**: WebLicht recommender
* **URL**: Do not change the default value unless you really know what you are doing (e.g. 
  developing custom WebLicht services).
* **Input format:** Plain text

Next, log in to link:https://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/[WebLicht] to build a processing chain.

The simplest way to build a chain is this:

* **Choose a sample input.** Make sure the language of the input matches the language of the documents
  in your {product-name} project. WebLicht will only allow you to add NLP services to the chain
  which are compatible with that language. For our example, we will choose `[en] Example Food`. Press **OK**.
* **Choose easy mode.** This allows you to conveniently select a few common types of annotations to
  generate.
* **Choose Named Entities.** For our example, we choose to generate named entity annotations, so
  we select this from the list on the left.
* **Download chain**. Click this button to download the chain definition. Once downloaded, it is a
  good idea to rename the file to something less cryptic than the default auto-generated ID, e.g.
  we might rename the file to `WebLicht_Named_Entities_English.xml`.

Back in the recommender settings, click **Browse** in the **Upload chain** field and select the processing chain definition file you have just generated. Then click the **Upload** button that appears in the field.

For good measure, **Save** the whole settings once more. When you now open a document in the 
annotation page, you should be able to see recommendations.

.Supported annotations
The WebLicht recommender can currently be used with the following built-in annotation layers:

* Part of speech
* Lemma
* Named entities (only the `value` feature)

.Using the TCF format
By default, the recommender sends data as plain text to WebLicht. This means that the processing
chain needs to run a tokenizer and sentence splitter. Since these might generate boundaries different
from the one you have in {product-name}, some of the recommendations might look odd or may not be
displayed at all. This can be avoided by sending data in the WebLicht TCF format. If you select this
format, the tokens and sentence boundaries will be sent to WebLicht along with the text. You will then
also need to specify the language of the documents that you are going to be sending. Note that even
when selecting the TCF format, only text, language, tokens and sentences are sent along - no other
annotations. Also, only the target layer and feature will be extracted from the processing chain's
results - no other annotations.

However, building a processing chain that takes TCF as input is a bit more difficult. When building
the chain, you need to upload some TCF file containing tokens, sentences, and the proper language
in the **Input selection** dialog of WebLicht. One way to get such a file is to open one of your
documents in the annotation page, export it in the TCF format, then opening the exported file in a
text editor an manually fixing the `lang` attribute on the `tc:TextCorpus` XML element. We know that
this is a bit inconvenient and try to come up with a better solution.
