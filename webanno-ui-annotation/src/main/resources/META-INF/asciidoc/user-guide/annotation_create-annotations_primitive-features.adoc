== Primitive Features

Supported primitive features types are string, boolean, integer, and float.
Boolean features are displayed as a checkbox that can either be marked or unmarked. Integer and 
float features are displayed using a number field. String features are displayed using a text field
or - in case they have a tagset - using a combobox.
