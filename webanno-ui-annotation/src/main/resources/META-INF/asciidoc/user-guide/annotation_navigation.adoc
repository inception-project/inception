The arrow buttons *first page*, *next page*, *previous page*, *last page*, and *go to page* allow you to navigate accordingly. The *Prev.* and *Next* buttons in the *Document* frame allow you to go to the previous or next document on your project list. You can also use the following keyboard assignments in order to navigate only using your keyboard.

Annotation of spans works by selecting the span, or double-clicking on a word. This activates the *Actions*-box on the right, where you can choose a layer. One can also type in the initial letters and chose the needed layer. After having chosen a layer, the drop-down menu inside the *Features*-box displays the features you can use during the annotation. The tag can be selected out of the drop-down menu inside the *Features*-box which contains the tags of the chosen layer.

To change or delete an annotation, double-click on the annotation (span or link annotations). The *Actions*-box is now activated. Changes and Deletions are possible via the respective buttons. 

Link annotations (between POS tags) are created by selecting the starting POS-tag, then dragging the arrow to connect it to its target POS tag. All possible targets are highlighted.
