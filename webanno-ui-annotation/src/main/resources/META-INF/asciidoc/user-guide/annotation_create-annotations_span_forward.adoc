= Forward annotation mode

The **forward annotation** mode is useful for annotation tasks where every single token should be
receiving an annotation - typical examples are part-of-speech of lemma annotation. When this mode is
enabled, completing an annotation automatically creates another annotation on the next token.

The forward annotation mode is available for layers fulfilling the following conditions:

* the layer is a **span** layer
* the layer anchors to **single tokens**
* there is exactly one **enabled** and **visible** **String** feature
* if the feature uses a tagset, this tagset must be non-empty 

If the feature is associated with a tagset, you will notice that the cursor does not jump to the
feature editor when an annotation is created. This is intentional. Assume your tagset includes the
tags `ADJ`, `ADV` and `NOUN`. When you press the `A` key once, the feature editor loads the first 
value starting with that letter, i.e. `ADJ`. Press `A` again to move to the second tag `ADV`. 
Pressing a key multiple times cycles through all the tags starting with the respective letter. Thus,
pressing `A` a third time loads `ADJ` again. Pressing `N` loads `NOUN`. 

If the feature is associated with a tagset, pressing the *BACKSPACE* key deletes the current
annotation and moves on. Otherwise the current annotation is removed if the feature editor is empty
(no value entered) when completing the annotation.

Press *ENTER* to complete the annotation and to move on to the next token. In the general case, 
a new annotation is created on the next token and it is loaded into the feature editor. However, 
if stacking or overlapping annotations not permitted and if there is already an annotation on that
token, this would naturally fail. In this case, no new annotation is created and instead an existing annotation is opened for
editing.

If the **Remember layer** setting is turned on, it is possible to select and edit an annotation
which is not on the layer for which the forward-mode is enabled. In this case, the forward-mode is
paused and the user can edit the annotation normally. The forward-mode resumes when the user
creates a new annotation or selects an annotation on the forward-enabled layer.
