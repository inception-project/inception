= Spans

To create an annotation over a span of text, click with the mouse on the text and drag the mouse to create a selection. When you release the mouse, the selected span is activated and highlighted in orange. The annotation detail editor is updated to display the text you have currently selected and to offer a choice on which layer the annotation is to be created. As soon as a layer has been selected, it is automatically assigned to the selected span. To delete an annotation, select a span and click on *Delete*. To deactivate a selected span, click on *Clear*.

Depending on the layer behavior configuration, spans annotations can have any length, can overlap,
can stack, can nest, and can cross sentence boundaries. 

.Example
For example, for NE annotation, select the options as shown below (red check mark):

link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition[NE] annotation can be chosen from a tagset and can span over several tokens within one sentence. Nested NE annotations are also possible (in the example below: "Frankfurter" in "Frankfurter FC").

.Zero-width spans
To create a zero-length annotation, hold *SHIFT* and click on the position where you wish to create the annotation. To avoid accidental creations of zero-length annotations, a simple single-click triggers no action by default. The *lock to token* behavior cancels the ability to create zero-length annotations.

NOTE: A zero-width span between two tokens that are directly adjacent, e.g. the full stop at the
      end of a sentence and the token before it (`end.`) is always considered to be *at the end of the
      first token* rather than at the beginning of the next token. So an annotation between `d` and `.`
      in this example would rendered at the right side of `end` rather than at the left side of `.`.
