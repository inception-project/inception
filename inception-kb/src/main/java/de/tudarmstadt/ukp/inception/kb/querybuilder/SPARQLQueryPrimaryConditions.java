/**
 * When working with queries using any of {@link #roots()}, @link #withIdentifier(String)}, @link
 * #childrenOf(String)}, {@link #descendantsOf(String)}, {@link #parentsOf(String)} or
 * {@link #ancestorsOf(String)}}, the FTS is internally disabled. These methods must be called
 * <b>before</b> any label-restricting methods like {@link #withLabelStartingWith(String)} This is
 * because the FTS part of the query pre-filters the potential candidates, but the FTS may not
 * return all candidates. Let's consider a large KB (e.g. Wikidata) and a query for <i>all humans
 * named Amanda in the Star Trek universe</i> (there is a category for <i>humans in the Star Trek
 * universe</i> in Wikidata). First the FTS would try to retrieve all entities named <i>Amanda</i>,
 * but it does not really return all, just the top 50 (which is what Wikidata seems to be hard-coded
 * to despite the documentation for <i>wikidata:limit</i> saying otherwise). None of these Amandas,
 * however, is part of the Star Trek universe, so the final result of the query is empty. Here, the
 * FTS restricts too much and too early. For such cases, we should rely on the scope sufficiently
 * limiting the returned results such that the regex-based filtering does not get too slow.
