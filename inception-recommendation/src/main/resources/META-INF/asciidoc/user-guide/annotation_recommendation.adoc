[[sect_annotation_recommendation]]
= Recommenders
After configuring one or more recommender in the <<sect_projects_recommendation, Project Settings>>,
they can be used during annotation to generate predictions. In the annotation view, predictions are
shown as grey bubbles next to normal annotations in blue. Predictions can be accepted by clicking
once on them. In order to reject, use a double-click. For an example how recommendations look in
action, please see the screenshot below.

Suggestions generated by a specific recommender can be deleted by removing the corresponding recommender
in the  <<sect_projects_recommendation, Project Settings>>. Clicking *Reset* in the _Workflow_ area
will remove all predictions, however it will also remove all hand-made annotations.

== Recommendation Sidebar

Clicking the speech bubble on the left opens the recommendation sidebar. There, one can set the
maximum number of recommendations that are displayed per span and feature. Also, by
ticking *Show hidden suggestions*, all recommendations are shown, even if an annotation at the given
position already exists. In order to save the new values, press *Save*.

=== Learning Curve Diagram

On the bottom of the recommendation sidebar, a learning curve diagram is shown. It plots a line for every recommender associated with the project. 
The learning curve line depicts the scores of a number of recent evaluations of a recommender. The y-axis of the chart represents the scores and the x-axis represents the time indices. For instance, if the recent 50 evaluations are plotted, the x-axis would be 0-50 with 50 being the latest point in time relative to the other points. Also, if the number of evaluations calculated so far are less than 50 then less points are shown on the x-axis. 
The shown score can be changed from accuracy to other scores via the retractable dropdown above the y-axis. 
The lines are only plotted for the enabled recommenders.
