[[sect_annotation_recommendation]]
= Recommenders
After configuring one or more recommender in the <<sect_projects_recommendation, Project Settings>>,
they can be used during annotation to generate predictions. In the annotation view, prediction are
shown as grey bubbles next to normal annotations in blue. Predictions can be accepted by clicking
once on them. In order to reject, use a double-click. For an example how recommendations look in
action, please see the screenshot below.

Suggestions generated by a specific recommender can be deleted by removing the corresponding recommender
in the  <<sect_projects_recommendation, Project Settings>>. Clicking *Reset* in the _Workflow_ area
will remove all predictions, however it will also remove all hand-made annotations.

== Recommendation Sidebar

Clicking the speech bubble on the left opens the recommendation sidebar. There, one can set the
maximum number of recommendations that are displayed for each token. Also, by ticking *Show all*,
all recommendations are shown, even if an annotation at the given position already exists. In order
to save the new values, press *Apply*.

=== Learning Curve Diagram

On the bottom of the recommendation sidebar, learning curve diagram is shown. It plots a line for every recommender associated with the project. The learning curve line depicts the scores from a number of recent evaluations of a recommender. The yaxis of the chart represents the scores and the xaxis represents the time indices. For instance, if recent 50 evaluations are plotted, xaxis would be 0-50 with 50 being the latest point in time relative to the other points. Also, if the number of evaluations calculated so far are less than 50 then lesser points are shown on the xaxis. The lines are only plotted for the enabled recommenders.
