=== Recommendation
Recommenders provide annotation support by predicting potential labels.
These can be either accepted or rejected by the user.
The recommenders learn from this interaction to further improve the quality of predictions.

After clicking on *Recommendation*, you are displayed a new pane in which you can add new recommenders
by clicking on the button *Create*. You have to select the layer, feature and the classification tool.
The recommenders are trained every time you create, update or delete an annotation;
and evaluated every second time. During recommender evaluation the f-score of each recommender is calcultated,
and recommenders with a lower f-score than their threshold will not be selected for the next training step.
By making a tick on the checkbox next to *Always active* or leaving the threshold at 0,
you can choose to skip f-score evaluation to ensure that the recommender runs at all times.

==== ClassificationTool types

* String Matcher
- This recommender projects the annotations already made to tokens with the same text.

* Multi-Token Sequence Classifier (OpenNlp Name Finder)
- This recommender makes predictions based on the Apache OpenNlp library.

* Token Sequence Classifier (OpenNlp POS Tagger)
- This recommender assigns part-of-speech tags, like NN(noun) or JJ(adjective) based on the Apache OpenNlp library.
The tag set used by the english pos model is the Penn Treebank tag set.
This recommender is specifically for the POS layer.

* Named Entity Linker
- A recommender specific to the `identifier` feature of the Named Entity layer.
It predicts the 3 highest ranked candidate entities for each each token annotated as Named Entity.
