= Evaluation Simulation

The evaluation simulation panel provides a visualization of the performance of the selected recommender with the help of a learning curve diagram. On the bottom right of the panel, the start button performs evaluation on the selected recommender using the annotated documents in the project and plots the evaluation scores against the training data size on the graph. The evaluation score can be one of the four metrics, Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1. There is a drop down panel to change the metric. The evaluation might take a long time.

For the evaluation, the training and test data is used from all the imported documents of the project. Moreover, the data is split into *80% training data* and *20% test data*. The training data is *incremented by 250* per evaluation.
