    <h2>Export backup archive</h2>
    
    <p class="small">
      Exports an archive containing the entire project. You can use this archive as a backup. The
      archive can be imported into this installation or into another installation of INCEpTION 
      that is using the same version as this one or a more recent version.
    </p>
    <p class="small">
      You can optionally choose to include the annotations in a secondary format in the archive.
      This means that the annotation data is then contained twice in the archive. Once in the 
      mandatory archival format used by INCEpTION and once in the format that you chose.
      Including a secondary format is useful when you want to further process the annotation data
      outside of INCEpTION. E.g. if you want to further process the data with Python, you might
      choose the <i>UIMA CAS XMI (XML 1.0)</i> format as the secondary format and then use 
      <a href="https://pypi.org/project/dkpro-cassis/">DKPro Cassis</a> to process the data further.
