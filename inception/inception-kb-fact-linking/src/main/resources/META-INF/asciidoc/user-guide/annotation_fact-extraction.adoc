= Fact Extraction

Fact extraction is the task of extracting facts from documents. It is defined that a fact consists
of a subject, a predicate, an object and qualifiers. Fact extraction in {product-name} includes
annotating the mentions for each fact component, and linking these mentions to instances of concept
classes or properties from the knowledge base.

This section briefly describes how to use the fact extraction functionality in {product-name}
alongside a running example. The example covers creating a local knowledge base supporting
qualifiers in the *Projects Settings*, managing qualifiers in the *Knowledge Base*, and extracting a
 fact in the *Annotation* page.

== A local knowledge base supporting qualifiers

In the *Projects Settings*, switch to the *Knowledge Bases* tab, then click *New…* on the bottom
and a dialogue box shows as in the figure below.

To create a local knowledge base, one needs to choose *Local* for the type. For the reification,
*NONE* is the default case, but one cannot add or view qualifiers in the knowledge base with *NONE*.
So, to support qualifiers, one needs to choose *WIKIDATA* for the Reification. One can then follow
the wizard to finish the setting.

== Managing qualifiers in the knowledge base

Assuming one has already created concepts, properties, instances and a statement about instance
_Barack Obama_ in this knowledge base:

One can click the button *+ Add qualifier*, choose a property _start-date_ for this qualifier name,
enter _1988_ for this qualifier value, and click *√* to save this qualifier.

One can click the pencil icon on the same line as this qualifier to edit and delete this qualifier.

== Linking a fact in the annotation page
Assuming the project contains documents for annotation, one can now switch to the annotation page
and choose the fact layer:

One can now mark the predicate mention of a fact. In the screenshot below, _enrolled in_ is selected.
The right sidebar shows feature editors for the predicate, the subject, the object and the
qualifiers. One can then choose _educated-at_ in the dropdown field of the predicate feature editor
to link the mention of this predicate to the property in the knowledge base. The candidate list of
this dropdown field is a list of properties in the knowledge base.

To annotate the subject mention of a fact, one needs to click *<Click to activate>* in the subject
feature editor. After this input field turns orange, one can now mark the subject mention _Obama_of
a fact. One can then choose _Barack Obama_ in the dropdown field of the subject feature editor to
link the mention of this subject to the instance in the knowledge base. The candidate list of this
dropdown field is a list of instances in the knowledge base. The default setting returns all the
instances from all the knowledge base in this project. See <<Fact linking with multiple knowledge bases>> to select a specific
knowledge base. After linking the subject to the knowledge base instance, in the main editor, there
is an arrow from the label above the predicate to the label above the subject, with a name _subject_.

Extracting the object mention is same as extracting the subject.

If this fact is already saved in the knowledge base, the label in the predicate feature editor shows
 *There is at least one statement in the KB which matches for this SPO*.

To extract a qualifier, one needs to choose the qualifier name from the drop-down field in front of
the button *add* in the qualifier feature editor. The list of candidates for the qualifier name is a
list of properties from the knowledge base. After clicking *add*, a mention input field and a
dropdown field appear to collect this qualifier value information. In the screenshot below, the
qualifier name is _start-date_.

image::factExtraction7.png[align="center"]

One can then click to activate the mention input, annotate the mention, and choose an instance from
the dropdown field to link the value of this qualifier to the knowledge base. The list of candidates
for the qualifier value is a list of instances from the knowledge base.

image::factExtraction8.png[align="center"]

After annotating this qualifier, in the main editor, there is an arrow from the label above the
predicate to the label above the qualifier value, with the qualifier name _start-date_.

So, a fact (Barack Obama, educated-at, Harvard Law School, Start-date: 1988) with its mentions is
linked in this example.

== Fact linking with multiple knowledge bases
If a project has multiple knowledge bases, a user can choose to link the mention to a certain
knowledge base or to all knowledge bases. This configuration is done in the *Projects Settings*. One
needs to switch to the *Layers* tab first, then to choose the *Named entity* layer and the
*identifier* feature. After that one can configure the linked knowledge base information in
*Feature Details*, choose the desired knowledge base from the dropdown list of the field *Knowledge
base* as shown in the figure below.
