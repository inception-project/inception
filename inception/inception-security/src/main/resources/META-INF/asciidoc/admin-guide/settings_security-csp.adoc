[[sect_security_csp]]
= Content Security Policy (CSP)

This section describes how to adjust the Content Security Policy (CSP) of {product-name}.
This may be necessary to enable/disable the ability to display images or media (audio/video) embedded to or referenced
from documents.

{product-name} by default allows loading content from its own host (`'self'`) and content embedded into the documents themselves (`data:`).
Additional sources can be added using the properties described below.

The Content Security Policy (CSP) are sent to the browser and interpreted by the browser.

.Content Security Policy (CSP) properties
[cols="4*", options="header"]
|===
| Setting
| Description
| Default
| Example
  
| `security.csp.allowed-image-sources`
| URLs from which images can be loaded
| *none*
| `https://upload.wikimedia.org`

| `security.csp.allowed-media-sources`
| URLs from which media (audio/video) can be loaded
| *none*
| `https://upload.wikimedia.org`
|===

Related to the CSP settings are the content policy setting for the HTML-based annotation editors and related formats such as MHTML or HTML (ZIP).
These allow enabling/disabling the filtering of images, audio, video and other related HTML tags.

* `NONE` configures the content filter to strip out the respective element while rendering. It will not reach the browser.
* `LOCAL` configures the content filter to allow the element to only access content embedded in the document. This allows
  accessing content embedded in MHTML or HTML (ZIP) files.
* `ANY` disables the filter for this element and allows any content to be loaded (CORS still applies).

Note that the `src` attribute of the `img`, `audio` and `video` elements must be used to reference the content.
Child `source` elements inside `img`, `audio` and `video` are not supported.

These filters are applied on the server side.

NOTE: By default, loading content embedded in documents is allowed so that users of {product-name} can easily get started
      working with multi-modal documents. However, security-conscious system administrators may wish to enable all the 
      `block-XXX` properties and to set the allowed sources to `NONE`.
