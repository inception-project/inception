[[sect_security_authentication_policy]]
= Policy

You have several options of configuring which types of usernames and passwords are accepted.
Note that these values are only enforced when creating new users or updating passwords. They
will not invalidate existing usernames or passwords. Length restrictions and patterns are checked
independently. If either fails, the username or password is rejected.

NOTE: When external pre-authentication is used, these settings are ignored.

NOTE: In addition to the restrictions imposed here, {product-name} may impose additional restrictions.
      E.g. certain usernames are not allowed and certain characters are also not allowed to appear in usernames.
