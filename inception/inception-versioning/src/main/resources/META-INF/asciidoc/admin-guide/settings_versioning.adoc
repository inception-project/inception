= 🧪 Versioning Settings

====
CAUTION: Experimental feature.
====

You can enable versioning for projects in your {product-name} instance.
Project managers can create snapshots of all documents in the project as well as its layer configuration via the versioning panel.
This is done via a git repository stored in the `+.inception+` folder.
This git repository can also be used to push to a remote repository, e.g. saving on Github or Gitlab.
