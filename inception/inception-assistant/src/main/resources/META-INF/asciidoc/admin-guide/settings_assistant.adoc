.Settings related to the assistant
[cols="4*", options="header"]
|===
| Setting
| Description
| Default
| Example

| `assistant.enabled`
| Whether to enable the assistant
| `false`
| `true`

| `assistant.url`
| URL of the Ollama service
| `http://localhost:11434`
| _some other URL_

| `assistant.nickname`
| The by which the assistant should identify itself.
| `INCEpTION`
| `Dominick`
|===

.Settings related to the assistant chat functionality
[cols="4*", options="header"]
|===
| Setting
| Description
| Default
| Example

| `assistant.chat.model`
| The model to use to drive the chat functionality of the assistant
| `llama3.2`
| `mistral-nemo`

| `assistant.chat.context-length`
| The context length supported by the model. 
This controls how much chat history will be preserved.
| `4096`
| `16000`

| `assistant.chat.top-p`
| Controls the diversity of output by sampling tokens from the smallest set whose probabilities sum to the threshold. 
Tune the balance between diversity (high, 0.9) and coherence (low, 0.3-0.5).
| `0.3`
| `0.90`

| `assistant.chat.top-k`
| Controls the number of top-ranked tokens considered for sampling during text generation. 
Tune the balance between diversity (high >= 50) and coherence (low e.g. 5).
| `25`
| `50`

| `assistant.chat.repeat-penalty`
| Discourages the model from repeating the same words or phrases by reducing the probability of tokens already generated, promoting more varied and coherent outputs. 
Tune the balance between less repetition (high >= 1.5) and more repetition (low, 1.0).
| `1.1`
| `1.5`

| `assistant.chat.temperature`
| Temperature controls the randomness of the model's output by adjusting the probability distribution of the next word. 
Tune the balance between more randomness (high >= 1.0) and less randomness (low, 0.5).
| `0.1`
| `0.8`

| `assistant.chat.encoding`
| The token encoding used by the model. 
  The encoding is used to estimate the number of tokens within {product-name}.
  This can help the application chunk the text more accurately.
  If in doubt, leave the default setting.  
| `cl100k_base`
| `r50k_base`, `p50k_base`, `p50k_edit`, `cl100k_base` or `o200k_base`
|===

.Settings related to the assistant search functionality
[cols="4*", options="header"]
|===
| Setting
| Description
| Default
| Example

| `assistant.embedding.model`
| The model to use to drive the search functionality of the assistant
| `granite-embedding`
| `snowflake-arctic-embed`

| `assistant.embedding.encoding`
| The token encoding used by the model. 
  The encoding is used to estimate the number of tokens within {product-name}.
  This can help the application chunk the text more accurately.
  If in doubt, leave the default setting.  
| `cl100k_base`
| `r50k_base`, `p50k_base`, `p50k_edit`, `cl100k_base` or `o200k_base`

| `assistant.embedding.dimension`
| The dimension of the embedding vectors created by the model.
  If this is set to `0`, the system will send a request to the LLM service during startup to auto-detect the vector size.
  Setting this manually can be helpful if the LLM service is potentially not available during startup.
  Changing the value will require indexes to be rebuilt.
  It is not recommended to use embeddings with a dimension higher than 1024 as this may result in increased memory usage and reduced performance.
|Â `0` (_detect automatically_)
| `256`

| `assistant.embedding.seed`
| The random number generator seed used to ensure repeatable retrieval results.
| `0xDEADBEEF`
| `12345678`

| `assistant.embedding.context-length`
| The context length supported by the model in LLM tokens.
  This controls how much of a chunk used to calculate the embedding.
  The setting should not be lower than the `chunk-size` setting.
| `768`
| `256`

| `assistant.embedding.batch-size`
| Maximum of chunks that should be send together to the LLM service when generating embeddings.
  Batching multiple chunks in a single request increases indexing speed.
| `16`
| `32`

.Settings related to the assistant search functionality accessing documents in the current project
[cols="4*", options="header"]
|===
| Setting
| Description
| Default
| Example

| `assistant.documents.chunk-size`
| The size of a chunk in LLM tokens.
  The setting should not be higher than the `assistant.embedding.context-length` setting to avoid truncation.
  It can be lower thought to create more topically focused chunks.
| `128`
| `768`

| `assistant.documents.max-chunks`
| Maximum number of relevant chunks from the user guide to pass to the LLM service.
| `3`
| `10`

| `assistant.documents.min-score`
| Minimum relevance score for chunks to be considered.
  This should be a positive number not larger than `1.0`.
| `0.8`
| `0.5`

| `assistant.documents.idle-eviction-delay`
| How often the index pool is checked for idle indexes.
| `5m`
| `5s`

| `assistant.documents.min-idle-time`
| How long an index may remain in the pool before being considered for eviction.
| `5m`
| `5s`

| `assistant.documents.borrow-wait-timeout`
| How long to wait for access to an index before timing out.
| `3m`
| `15s`

.Settings related to the user guide integration
[cols="4*", options="header"]
|===
| Setting
| Description
| Default
| Example

| `assistant.user-guide.rebuild-index-on-boot`
| Whether to re-build the user manual index at the start of the application.
| `false`
| `true`

| `assistant.user-guide.max-chunks`
| Maximum number of relevant chunks from the user guide to pass to the LLM service.
| `3`
| `10`

| `assistant.user-guide.min-score`
| Minimum relevance score for chunks to be considered.
  This should be a positive number not larger than `1.0`.
