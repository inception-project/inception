[[sect_assistant]]
= ðŸ§ª Assistant

====
CAUTION: Experimental feature. To use this functionality, you need to enable it first by adding `assistant.enabled=true` to the `settings.properties` file (see the <<admin-guide.adoc#sect_settings_assistant, Admin Guide>>). While this feature introduces a new level of flexibility, it can also interact with existing features in unexpected and untested ways.
====

The assistant sidebar on the annotation page allows you to integrate an LLM-based AI assistant into {product-name}.
Currently, the assistant is only accessible on the annotation page, not in other parts of the application.
The assistant has limited access to the user manual and can provide some guideance on how to use {product.name}.
It also has access to the documents contained in the project and use this information to provide more context-aware responses.

Currently, the assistant is only able to connect to an Ollama service that does not require authentication.
The service already needs to be running when you start {product-name} and the models need to be available in the service.

By default, the following models are used by the assistant:

* `llama3.2` to drive the chat
* `granite-embedding` for the searching the documents

You can configure the system to use other models.
When changing the embedding model, the assistant indices will need to be rebuilt.
Any models you choose need to support at least English as a language.
