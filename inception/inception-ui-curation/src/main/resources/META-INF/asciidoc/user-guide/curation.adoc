[[sect_curation]]
= Curation

NOTE: This functionality is only available to *curators*.

== Opening a Document for Curation

When navigating to the *Curation Page*, the procedure for opening projects and documents is the same as in <<sect_annotation>>. The navigation within the document is also equivalent to <<sect_annotation>>.

The table reflects the state of the document. A document can be *in-progress*, *finished*, *curation-in-progress* or *curation-finished*. 

== Curating a document

On the left, there is a sidebar titled *Units*, an overview of the chosen document is displayed. Units are represented by their number inside the document. Click on a unit in order to select it and to to edit it in the central part of the page.

The units are shown using different colors that indicate their state. Since the calculation of
the state can take significant time, it is not updated as changes are made in the main editor pane.
To update the coloring of the unit overview, use the *Refresh* button. When switching between
documents, the overview is automatically refreshed.

NOTE: In order for the unit overview to consider a unit as *Curated*, the curation pane must
contain an annotation for all positions that any of the annotators have annotated. This implies
that the *Curated* state requires the curator to have made an annotation. It is not possible
at this time to mark a unit as curated in which an annotator has made an annotator, but the
curator has not (e.g. because the curator considers the annotator's annotation to be entirely
wrong and misplaced).

The center part of the annotation page is divided into the *Annotation* pane which is a full-scale
annotation editor and contains the final data from the curation step. 

Below it are multiple read-only panes containing the annotations from individual annotators. 
Clicking on an annotation in any of the annotator's panes transfers the respective annotation to the *Annotation* pane.
There is also a small state icon for each annotator. If you click on that icon, you can change the state, e.g. from *finished* back to *in progress*. Note if you do that, the respective annotators document will no longer be available for curation. When the last finished annotation for a document is reopened, you will be forced to leave curation.

When a document is opened for the first time in the curation page, the application analyzes agreements
and disagreements between annotators. All annotations on which all annotators agree are automatically
copied to the *Annotation* pane. Any annotations on which the annotators disagree are skipped.

The annotator's panes are color-coded according to their relation with the contents of the *Annotation* pane and according to the agreement status. The colors largely match the colors also used in the status over in the left sidebar.

NOTE: The upper *Annotation* pane that the curator uses to edit annotations is not color-coded. It uses whatever coloring strategy is configured in the *Settings* dialog.

.Explanation of the annotation colors in the annotator's panes (lower panes)
[cols="1,3"]
|===
| Green 
| *Accepted by the curator:* the annotation matches the corresponding annotation in the *Annotation* pane.

| Cyan 
| *Rejected by the curator: *the annotation does not match the corresponding annotation in the *Annotation* pane.

| Orange
| *Annotators agree:* the annotators all agree but curator has not accepted the annotation yet (there is no corresponding annotation in the *Annotation* pane).

| Red
| *Annotators disagree:* the annotators disagree and the curator has not yet taken any action (there is also no corresponding annotation in the upper *Annotation* pane).

| Purple
| *Annotation is incomplete:* not all annotators have provided a annotation for this position and the curator has not yet taken any action (there is no corresponding annotation in the upper *Annotation* pane).
|===

**Left-click** on an annotation in one of the lower panels to merge it. This action copies the annotation to the upper panel. The merged annotation will turn green in the lower panel from which it was selected. If other annotators had a conflicting opinion, these will turn red in the lower panels of the respective annotators. 

**Right-click** on an annotation in the lower panels to bring up a menu with additional options.

* **Merge all XXX**: merge all annotations of the given type from the selected annotator. Note that
  this overrides any annotations of the type which may previously have been merged or manually 
  created in the upper panel.

[#merging-strategies]
== Merging strategies

{product-name} supports several different strategies for pre-merging data from the annotators to the curated document. The default strategy is **Merge completely agreeing non-stacked annotations**, but this default can be changed by the project manager in the project settings. It is also possible to update the default settings from the **Re-merge** dialog on the curation page.

=== Merge completely agreeing non-stacked annotations

This merge strategy only considers annotations if all annotators made the same 
annotation at the same location (i.e. complete and agreeing annotations) - i.e. it considers any 
annotations not provided by all annotators as a disagreement between the annotators.

=== Merge incomplete agreeing non-stacked annotations

There are situations where it is desirable to merge annotations from all annotators, even
if some did not provide it. For example, if your project has two annotators, one working on POS
tagging and another working on lemmatization, then as a curator, you might simply want to merge the
annotators from the two.

=== Merge using thresholds

This is the most powerful and flexible strategy. It is also the only strategy so far that supports merging stacked annotations.

The strategy is controlled by three parameters:

* **User threshold:** the minimum amount of annotators that must have voted for a given 
label for the label to be considered at all. If less then this number of annotators as 
assigned the label, then it is completely ignored.
* **Confidence threshold:** the minimum confidence of a label. The confidence for a label is calculated by counting the total number annotators (`all_votes`) that annotated a given position and dividing the number of annotators that provided a given label by the total number (i.e. `votes(label)  / all_votes`. Note that the user threshold is applied before counting votes to calculate confidence. Note how the confidence interacts with the number of valid labels you expect. E.g. if you expect that there could be four valid labels (and therefore set the **top-voted** parameter to `4`), then the best confidence that a single label can have is **25%** (`= 100% / 4``).
* **Top-voted:** when set to `1`, only the single best label is pre-merged. If there is a tie on the best label, then nothing is merged. When set to `2` or higher, the respective `n` best labels are pre-merged. If there is any tie within the `n` best labels, then all labels that still meet the lowest score of the tie are merged as well. For example, if set to `2` and three annotators voted for label `X` and another two anotators voted for `Y` and `Z` respectively, then `Y` and `Z` have a tie at the second rank, so both of them are merged. Note that this setting only affects annotations on layers that allow stacking annotations. For other layers, an implicit setting of `1` is used here.

== Anonymized curation
By default, the curator can see the annotators names on the curation page. However, in some cases,
it may not be desirable for the curator to see the names. In this case, enable the option
*Anonymous curation* in the project detail settings. Users with the curator role will then only
see an anonymous label like *Anonymized annotator 1* instead of the annotator names. Users who are
project managers can still see the annotator names.

NOTE: The order of the annotators is not randomized - only the names are removed from the UI. Only 
      annotators who have marked their documents as *finished* are shown. Thus, which annotator receives
      which number may changed depending on documents being marked as finished or put back into progress.
