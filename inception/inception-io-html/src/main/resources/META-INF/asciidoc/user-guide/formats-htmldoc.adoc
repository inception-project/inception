[[sect_formats_htmldoc]]
= ðŸ§ª HTML

====
CAUTION: Experimental feature. To use this functionality, you need to enable it first by adding `format.html.enabled` to the `settings.properties` file.
====

Generic support for HTML documents. This format imports the entire HTML document structure and is
able to retain it until export. None of the HTML elements are converted to editable annotations
though. In combination with a HTML-based editor, this format allows annotating in HTML documents
while retaining most of the HTML layout. Note that some HTML elements and attributes are filtered
out during rendering. These include e.g. JavaScript-related elements and attributes as well as
links which could easily interfere with the functionality of the annotation editor.
