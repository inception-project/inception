## Opening the PDF Editor

To switch to the PDF editor for an opened document, click on `Settings` in the
`Document` panel located at the top.
In the section `General Display Preferences` select `PDF` for the `Editor` field.
Save your settings.
The PDF editor will open.

## Navigation

Once the editor is loaded you can see the opened PDF document.
To navigate through the document you can hover your mouse over the PDF panel and
use the mouse wheel for scrolling.
After clicking in the PDF panel it is also possible to use the `Up` and `Down`
keys of the keyboard.
For a faster navigation the `Page Up` and `Page Down` keys can be used.
In the PDF panel on the top left there are buttons for switching to the previous
or next page in the document.
Next to the buttons you can enter a page number to jump to a specific page.

In the top center of the PDF panel the zoom level of the document can be adjusted.

The button on the top right in the PDF panel opens a small menu which provides
functionality to go to the first or last page.
You can also use the `Home` and `End` keys instead.
The menu also contains an option to enable the hand tool to navigate through the document via clicking
and dragging the pages.

When moving through the document annotations will not show immediately.
Once the movement stops for a short period of time the annotations for the
previous, current and next page will be loaded.
The loading process might take a few seconds.

## Creating Span Annotations

To create a span annotation first select the desired layer for it.
This can be done in the `Layer box` on the right sidebar.
If another annotation is already selected press the `Clear` button on the right
sidebar.

Once you have chosen a layer, select the desired text to create a span annotation.
This can be done by clicking at the beginning of the text span, dragging until
the end and then releasing the mouse button.
In the upper right corner you can see a moving circle which indicates that the
creation of the annotation is in process.

The creation might take a few seconds.
Once finished the new span annotation will be rendered if it was created
successfully.
If it was not possible to create the annotation an error message is shown.
After the span annotation is created it will be automatically selected in the
`Layer box`.

## Creating Relation Annotations

To create a relation annotation click on the knob of a span annotation and drag
and drop on another span annotation knob.
In order to create a relation annotation between two spans an according layer
must exist.

After releasing the mouse button the creation process starts which is indicated
by a moving circle in the upper right corner.
This might take a few seconds.
Once finished the new relation annotation will be rendered if it was created
successfully.
If it was not possible to create the annotation an error message is shown.
After the relation annotation is created it will be automatically selected in
the `Layer box`.

Currently long distance relation annotations are not creatable as annotations are
rendered dynamically when moving through the pages.

## Selecting Span and Relation Annotations

Span annotations can be selected by clicking on their span annotation knob.

To select relation annotations click on the relation arc.

## Modifying Span and Relation Annotations

To modify an existing span or relation annotation you first need to select it.

Once an annotation is selected it will be shown in the `Layer box`.

You can now edit the selected annotation.

## Deleting Span and Relation Annotations

First select the annotation that will be deleted.

The selected annotation will be shown in the `Layer box`.

To delete the annotation click on the `Delete` button on the right sidebar.

## Accepting Recommendations

To accept and convert a recommendation to an actual span annotation
select it.

The recommendation is converted to an actual annotation and is selected
automatically.

## Rejecting Recommendations

To reject a recommendation quickly double click the span annotation
knob.

The recommendation then will be removed from the editor.
