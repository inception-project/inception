pos-layer.description=Part-of-speech annotations assign grammatical categories (such as nouns, verbs, etc.) to each \
  word in a text. The layer comes with the [Universal POS Tags](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/) \
  pre-configured.
lemma-layer.description=Lemma annotations assign the base or dictionary form to a word.
named-entity-layer.description=Named Entity Tagging, also known as Named Entity Recognition (NER) identifies and \
  classifies named entities in text into predefined categories. Named entities are specific objects, individuals, \
  locations, dates, numerical values, and other proper nouns.
chunk-layer.description=Chunking identifies and labels contiguous sequences of words, called chunks, into meaningful \
  syntactic units, such as noun phrases or verb phrases.
surface-form-layer.description=Surface form annotations identify parts of a text that have been normalized and label \
  them with the original non-normalized text. For example, if you have normalized `it's` into `it is`, then you can \
  use a surface form annotation to encode the orignal text.
dependency-layer.description=Dependency annotations represent the syntactic relationships between words in a \
  sentence. The layer comes with the [Universal Dependency Relations](https://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/) \
  pre-configured.
coreference-layer.description=Coreference annotations identifying and linking expressions in a text that refer to the \
  same entity. Coreference occurs when a word or phrase in a sentence refers back to a previously mentioned entity,  \
  typically using pronouns or other referencing expressions.
morpholological-features-layer.description=Morphological features identify aspects of a word's structure and form, \
  specifically focusing on its internal components and variations. These features include elements such as prefixes, \
  suffixes, roots, and inflections.
orthography-layer.description=Orthography annotations identify mis-spelled words and label them with the correct \
  spelling. 
predicate-argument-layer.description=Predicate-argument annotation identifies the relationships between predicates \
  (verbs or actions) and their associated arguments (noun phrases, pronouns, or other entities) within a sentence. \
  It can also be used to represent semantic frames. A frame is a conceptual scenario or situation, often associated \
  with a particular verb or predicate, and it includes various roles or participants that play specific semantic roles \
  in that scenario.
