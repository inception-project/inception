[[sect_casdoctor]]
= CAS Doctor

The CAS Doctor is an essential development tool. When enabled, it checks the CAS for
consistency when loading or saving a CAS. It can also automatically repair inconsistencies when
configured to do so. This section gives an overview of the available checks and repairs.

It is safe to enable any <<sect_checks,checks>>. However, active checks may considerably slow down 
the application, in particular for large documents or for actions that work with many documents, e.g. 
curation or the calculation of agreement. Thus, checks should not be enabled on a production system
unless the application behaves strangely and it is necessary to check the documents for consistency.

Enabling <<sect_repairs,repairs>> should be done with great care as most repairs are performing
destructive actions. Repairs should never be enabled on a production system. The repairs are
executed in the order in which they are appear in the `debug.casDoctor.repairs` setting. This is
important in particular when applying destructive repairs.

When documents are loaded, CAS Doctor first tries to apply any enabled <<sect_repairs,repairs>>
and afterwards applies enabled <<sect_checks,checks>> to ensure that the potentially repaired
document is consistent.

Additionally, CAS Doctor applies enabled <<sect_checks,checks>> *before* saving a document. This
ensures that a bug in the user interface introduces inconsistencies into the document on disk. I.e.
the consistency of the persisted document is protected! Of course, it requires that relevant checks
have been implemented and are actually enabled.

By default, CAS Doctor generates an exception when a check or repair fails. This ensures that
inconsistencies are contained and do not propagate further. In some cases, e.g. when it is known
that by its nature an inconsistency does not propagate and can be avoided by the user, it may be
convenient to allow the user to continue working with the application while a repair is being developed.
In such a case, CAS Doctor can be configured to be non-fatal. Mind that users can always continue
to work on documents that are consistent. CAS Doctor only prevents loading inconsistent documents
and saving inconsistent documents.

[[sect_checks]]
== Checks

[[check_AllFeatureStructuresIndexedCheck]]
=== All feature structures indexed

[horizontal]
ID:: `AllFeatureStructuresIndexedCheck`
Related repairs:: <<repair_RemoveDanglingChainLinksRepair>>, <<repair_RemoveDanglingRelationsRepair>>, <<repair_ReindexFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsRepair>>, <<repair_RemoveDanglingFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsRepair>>

This check verifies if all reachable feature structures in the CAS are also indexed. We do not
currently use any un-indexed feature structures. If there are any un-indexed feature structures in the
CAS, it is likely due to a bug in the application and can cause undefined behavior.

For example, older versions of {product-name} had a bug that caused deleted spans still to be
accessible through relations which had used the span as a source or target.

This check is very extensive and slow. 


[[check_FeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsTrulyAttachedCheck]]
=== Feature-attached spans truly attached

[horizontal]
ID:: `FeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsTrulyAttachedCheck`
Related repairs:: <<repair_ReattachFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsRepair>>, <<repair_ReattachFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsAndDeleteExtrasRepair>>

Certain span layers are attached to another span layer through a feature reference
from that second layer. For example, annotations in the POS layer must always be referenced from
a Token annotation via the Token feature `pos`. This check ensures that annotations on layers such
as the POS layer are properly referenced from the attaching layer (e.g. the Token layer).


[[check_LinksReachableThroughChainsCheck]]
=== Links reachable through chains

[horizontal]
ID:: `LinksReachableThroughChainsCheck`
Related repairs:: <<repair_RemoveDanglingChainLinksRepair>>

Each chain in a chain layers consist of a *chain* and several *links*. The chain
points to the first link and each link points to the following link. If the CAS contains any links
that are not reachable through a chain, then this is likely due to a bug.


[[check_NoMultipleIncomingRelationsCheck]]
=== No multiple incoming relations

[horizontal]
ID:: `NoMultipleIncomingRelationsCheck`

Check that nodes have only one in-going dependency relation inside the same annotation layer.
Since dependency relations form a tree, every node of this tree can only have at most one parent node.
This check outputs a message that includes the sentence number (useful to jump directly to the problem) and the actual offending dependency edges.


[[check_NoZeroSizeTokensAndSentencesCheck]]
=== No 0-sized tokens and sentences

[horizontal]
ID:: `NoZeroSizeTokensAndSentencesCheck`
Related repairs:: <<repair_RemoveZeroSizeTokensAndSentencesRepair>>

Zero-sized tokens and sentences are not valid and can cause undefined behavior.


[[check_RelationOffsetsCheck]]
=== Relation offsets consistency

[horizontal]
ID:: `RelationOffsetsCheck`
Related repairs:: <<repair_RelationOffsetsRepair>>

Checks that the offsets of relations match the target of the relation. This mirrors the DKPro
Core convention that the offsets of a dependency relation must match the offsets of the 
dependent.


[[check_CASMetadataTypeIsPresentCheck]]
=== CASMetadata presence
[horizontal]
ID:: `CASMetadataTypeIsPresentCheck`
Related repairs:: <<repair_UpgradeCasRepair>>

Checks if the internal type `CASMetadata` is defined in the type system of this CAS. If this is
not the case, then the application may not be able to detect concurrent modifications.


[[check_DanglingRelationsCheck]]
=== Dangling relations
[horizontal]
ID:: `DanglingRelationsCheck`
Related repairs:: <<repair_RemoveDanglingRelationsRepair>>

Checks if there are any relations that do not have a source or target. Either the source/end are
not set at all or they refer to an unset attach feature in another layer. Note that relations
referring to non-indexed end-points are handled by <<check_AllFeatureStructuresIndexedCheck>>.


[[check_NegativeSizeAnnotationsCheck]]
=== Negative-sized annotations check
[horizontal]
ID:: `NegativeSizeAnnotationsCheck`
Related repairs:: <<repair_SwitchBeginAndEndOnNegativeSizedAnnotationsRepair>>

Checks if there are any annotations with a begin offset that is larger than their end offset. Such
annotations are invalid and may cause errors in many functionalities of {product-name}.


[[check_AllAnnotationsStartAndEndWithinSentencesCheck]]
=== Negative-sized annotations check
[horizontal]
ID:: `AllAnnotationsStartAndEndWithinSentencesCheck`
Related repairs:: <<repair_CoverAllTextInSentencesRepair>>

Checks that the begins and ends of all annotations are within the boundaries of a sentence.
Annotations that are not within sentence boundaries may not be shown by certain annotation editors
such as the default sentence-oriented brat editor. Also, sentence-oriented formats such as WebAnno
TSV or CoNLL formats will not include any text and annotations of parts of the documents that is
not covered by sentences or may produce errors during export.


[[check_UnreachableAnnotationsCheck]]
=== Unreachable annotations check
[horizontal]
ID:: `UnreachableAnnotationsCheck`
Related repairs:: <<repair_UpgradeCasRepair>>

Checks if there are any unreachable feature structures. Such feature structures take up memory, but
they are not regularly accessible. Such feature structures may be created as a result of bugs.
Removing them is harmless and reduces memory and disk space usage.

[[check_AllAnnotationsStartAndEndWithCharactersCheck]]
=== All annotations start and end with characters
[horizontal]
ID:: `check_AllAnnotationsStartAndEndWithCharactersCheck`
Related repairs:: <<repair_TrimAnnotationsRepair>>

Checks if all annotations start and end with a character (i.e. not a whitespace). Annotations that start or end with a
whitespace character can cause problems during rendering. Trimming whitespace at the begin and end is typically as 
harmless procedure.

[[check_DocumentTextStartsWithBomCheck]]
=== Document text starts with Byte Order Mark
[horizontal]
ID:: `check_DocumentTextStartsWithBomCheck`
Related repairs:: <<repair_RemoveBomRepair>>

Checks if the document text starts with a Byte Order Mark (BOM).


[[sect_repairs]]
== Repairs

[[repair_ReattachFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsRepair]]
=== Re-attach feature-attached spans

[horizontal]
ID:: `ReattachFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsRepair`

This repair action attempts to attach spans that should be attached to another span, but are not.
E.g. it tries to set the `pos` feature of tokens to the POS annotation for that respective token.
The action is not performed if there are multiple stacked annotations to choose from. Stacked
attached annotations would be an indication of a bug because attached layers are not allowed to
stack.

This is a safe repair action as it does not delete anything.


[[repair_ReattachFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsAndDeleteExtrasRepair]]
=== Re-attach feature-attached spans and delete extras

[horizontal]
ID:: `ReattachFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsAndDeleteExtrasRepair`

This is a destructive variant of <<repair_ReattachFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsRepair>>. In
addition to re-attaching unattached annotations, it also removes all extra candidates that cannot
be attached. For example, if there are two unattached Lemma annotations at the position of a Token
annotation, then one will be attached and the other will be deleted. Which one is attached and 
which one is deleted is undefined.


[[repair_ReindexFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsRepair]]
=== Re-index feature-attached spans

[horizontal]
ID:: `ReindexFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsRepair`

This repair locates annotations that are reachable via a attach feature but which are not actually
indexed in the CAS. Such annotations are then added back to the CAS indexes.

This is a safe repair action as it does not delete anything.


[[repair_RelationOffsetsRepair]]
=== Repair relation offsets

[horizontal]
ID:: `RelationOffsetsRepair`

Fixes that the offsets of relations match the target of the relation. This mirrors the DKPro
Core convention that the offsets of a dependency relation must match the offsets of the 
dependent.


[[repair_RemoveDanglingChainLinksRepair]]
=== Remove dangling chain links

[horizontal]
ID:: `RemoveDanglingChainLinksRepair`

This repair action removes all chain links that are not reachable through a chain.

Although this is a destructive repair action, it is likely a safe action in most cases. Users are
not able see chain links that are not part of a chain in the user interface anyway.

[[repair_RemoveDanglingFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsRepair]]
=== Remove dangling feature-attached span annotations

[horizontal]
ID:: `RemoveDanglingFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsRepair`

This repair action removes all annotations which are themselves no longer indexed (i.e. they have
been deleted), but they are still reachable through some layer to which they had attached. This 
affects mainly the DKPro Core POS and Lemma layers.

Although this is a destructive repair action, it is sometimes a desired action because the user may
know that they do not care to resurrect the deleted annotation as per <<repair_ReindexFeatureAttachedSpanAnnotationsRepair>>.


[[repair_RemoveDanglingRelationsRepair]]
=== Remove dangling relations

[horizontal]
ID:: `RemoveDanglingRelationsRepair`

This repair action removes all relations that point to unindexed spans. 

Although this is a destructive repair action, it is likely a safe action in most cases. When
deleting a span, normally any attached relations are also deleted (unless there is a bug).
Dangling relations are not visible in the user interface. A dangling relation is one that meets
any of the following conditions:

* source or target are not set
* the annotation pointed to by source or target is not indexed
* the attach-feature in the annotation pointed to by source or target is not set
* the annotation pointed to by  attach-feature in the annotation pointed to by source or target is
  not indexed


[[repair_RemoveZeroSizeTokensAndSentencesRepair]]
=== Remove 0-size tokens and sentences

[horizontal]
ID:: `RemoveZeroSizeTokensAndSentencesRepair`

This is a destructive repair action and should be used with care. When tokens are removed, also
any attached lemma, POS, or stem annotations are removed. However, no relations that attach to 
lemma, POS, or stem are removed, thus this action could theoretically leave dangling relations
behind. Thus, the <<repair_RemoveDanglingRelationsRepair>> repair action should be configured
*after* this repair action in the settings file.


[[repair_UpgradeCasRepair]]
=== Upgrade CAS

[horizontal]
ID:: `UpgradeCasRepair`

Ensures that the CAS is up-to-date with the project type system. It performs the same operation
which is regularly performed when a user opens a document for annotation/curation.

This repair also removes any unreachable feature structures. Such feature structures may be created as a result of bugs.
Removing them is harmless and reduces memory and disk space usage.

This is considered to be safe repair action as it only garbage-collects data from the CAS that is
no longer reachable anyway.


[[repair_SwitchBeginAndEndOnNegativeSizedAnnotationsRepair]]
=== Switch begin and end offsets on negative-sized annotations

[horizontal]
ID:: `SwitchBeginAndEndOnNegativeSizedAnnotationsRepair`

This repair switches the begin and end offsets on all annotations where the begin offset is larger
than the begin offset.


[[repair_CoverAllTextInSentencesRepair]]
=== Cover all text in sentences

[horizontal]
ID:: `CoverAllTextInSentencesRepair`

This repair checks if there is any text not covered by sentences. If there is, it creates a new
sentence annotation on this text starting at the end of the last sentence before it (or the start
of the document text) and the begin of the next sentence (or the end of the document text).

[[repair_TrimAnnotationsRepair]]
=== Trim annotations

[horizontal]
ID:: `TrimAnnotationsRepair`

This repair adjusts annotation boundaries such that they do not include any whitespace at the beginning or end of the 
annotation.

NOTE: Run the checks again after applying this repair as certain annotations can become invalid if they get trimmed down
      to a length of zero. It may be necessary to apply another repair such as <<repair_RemoveZeroSizeTokensAndSentencesRepair>>
      to remove these annotations.

[[repair_RemoveBomRepair]]
=== Remove Byte Order Mark

[horizontal]
ID:: `RemoveBomRepair`

This repair removes the Byte Order Mark at the start of the document and adjusts all annotation offsets accordingly.
