[[sect_formats_uimajson_legacy]]
= ðŸª¦ UIMA CAS JSON

====
CAUTION: Legacy feature. To use this functionality, you need to enable it first by adding `format.json-cas-legacy.enabled=true` to the `settings.properties` file. 

Support for this feature will be removed in a future version. The replacement is <<sect_formats_uimajson>>.
====

This is an old and deprecated UIMA CAS JSON format which can be exported but not imported.
It should no longer be used. Instead, one should turn to <<sect_formats_uimajson>>.

The format does support custom layers.

For more details on this format, please refer to the link:https://uima.apache.org/d/uimaj-current/references.html#ugr.ref.json[UIMA Reference Guide].

By default, the format writes all values to the JSON output, even if the values are the default values
in JSON (e.g. `0` for numbers or `false` for booleans). You can configure this behavior by setting
`format.json-cas-legacy.omit-default-values` to `true` or `false` (default) respectively.
