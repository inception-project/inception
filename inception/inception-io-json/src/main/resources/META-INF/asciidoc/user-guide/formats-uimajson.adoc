[[sect_formats_uimajson]]
= UIMA CAS JSON

This is a new and still experimental UIMA CAS JSON format which is able to capture not only the
annotations but also the type system. As such, it is self-contained like the <<sect_formats_uimabinarycas>>
format while at the same time being more readable than the <<sect_formats_uimaxmi>> format.

Support for this format is available in the following implementations:

* link:https://github.com/apache/uima-uimaj-io-jsoncas[Apache UIMA Java SDK JSON CAS Support] (Java).
  This is the implementation we use here.
* link:https://github.com/dkpro/dkpro-cassis[DKPro Cassis] (Python)

The current draft specification of the format is available link:https://github.com/apache/uima-uimaj-io-jsoncas/blob/main/SPECIFICATION.adoc[here].
