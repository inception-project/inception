NOTE: This functionality is only available to *managers* of existing projects, 
      *project creators* (users with the ability to create new projects), and *administrators*.

Here, you can define the name of your project. 

A suitable URL slug is automatically derived from the project name if you do not provide one yourself.
The URL slug will be used in the browser URLs for the different pages belonging to the project.
For example, if you project has the URL slug `my-project`, then it will be accessible under
an URL ending in `/p/myproject`.
The URL slug must be unique for all projects.
Only lower-case characters (a-z), numbers (0-9), dashes (`-`) and underscores (`_`) are allowed for the slug.
Also, it must be at least 3 characters and can be at most 40 characters long.
The slug must start with a letter.

Finally, you can provide a project description here which is displayed on the project dashboard.

When you have not save the project yet, you can cancel the creation of the project via the *Close* button.
To delete a project after you have saved (i.e. created) it, use the *Delete* button.
