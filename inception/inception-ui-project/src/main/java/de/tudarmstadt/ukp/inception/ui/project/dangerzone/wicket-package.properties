deleteProjectTitle=Delete this project
deleteProjectWarning=Deleting a project is an irreversible action. Be sure this is really what you want. \
  There is no going back. You may want to export the project first to have a backup \
  before deleting it. Mind you might also want to check that you can successfully \
  re-import the project before you finally delete it.
