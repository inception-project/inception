            <h5>Delete this project</h5>
            Deleting a project is an irreversible action. Be sure this is really what you want.
            There is no going back. You may want to export the project first to have a backup
            before deleting it. Mind you might also want to check that you can successfully
            re-import the project before you finally delete it.
