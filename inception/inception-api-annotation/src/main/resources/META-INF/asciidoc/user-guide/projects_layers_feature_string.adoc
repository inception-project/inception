[[sect_layers_feature_string]]
= String features

A string feature either holds a short tag (optionally from a restricted tag set) or a note (i.e. a multi-line text).

When no tagset is associated with the string feature, it is displayed to the user simply as a
single line input field. You can enable the *multiple rows* option to turn it into a multi-line
text area. If you do so, additional options appear allowing to configure the size of the text area
which can be fixed or dynamic (i.e. automatically adjust to the text area content).

Optionally, a <<sect_projects_tagsets,tagset>> can be associated with a string feature (unless you enabled multiple rows). If string feature is associated with a tagset, there are different options
as to which type of *editor type* (i.e. input field) is displayed to the user.

.Editor types for string features with tagsets
[cols="1v,2", options="header"]
|====
| Editor type | Description

| Auto
| An editor is chosen automatically depending on the size of the tagset and whether annotators can add to it.

| Radio group
| Each tag is shown as a button. Only one button can be active at a time. Best for quick access to small tagsets. Does not allow annotators to add new tags (yet).

| Combo box
| A text field with auto-completion and button that opens a drop-down list showing all possible tags and their descriptions. Best for mid-sized tagsets.

| Autocomplete
| A text field with auto-completion. A dropdown opens when the user starts typing into the field and it displays matching tags. There is no way to browse all available tags. Best for large tagsets.

|====

The tagset size thresholds used by the *Auto* mode to determine which editor to choose can be globally configured by an administrator via the <<admin_guide.adoc#sect_settings_annotation,`settings.properties`>> file. 
Because the radio group editor does not support adding new tags (yet), it chosen automatically only if the associated tagset does not allow annotators to add new tags.

.String feature properties
[cols="1v,2", options="header"]
|====
| Property | Description

| Tagset
| The tagset controlling the possible values for a string feature.

| Show only when constraints apply
| Display the feature only if any constraint rules apply to it (cf. <<sect_constraints_conditional_features>>)

| Editor type
| The type of input field shown to the annotators.

| Multiple Rows
| If enabled the textfield will be replaced by a textarea which expands on focus. This also enables options to set the size of the textarea and disables tagsets.

| Dynamic Size
| If enabled the textfield will dynamically resize itself based on the content. This disables collapsed and expanded row settings. 

| Collapsed Rows
| Set the number of rows for the textarea when it is collapsed and not focused.

| Expanded Rows
| Set the number of rows for the textarea when it is expanded and not focused.
