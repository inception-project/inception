= ðŸ§ª Cross-layer relations

====
CAUTION: Experimental feature. To use this functionality, you need to enable it first by adding `ui.cross-layer-relations-enabled=true` to the `settings.properties` file (see the <<admin-guide.adoc#sect_settings_cross-layer-relations, Admin Guide>>). While this feature introduces a new level of flexibility, it can also interact with existing features in unexpected and untested ways.
====

By default, relations can only be created between two endpoints on the same layer.
Also, it is only possible to create a single relation layer for any given span layer.

Enable this experimental option feature the creation of relation layers that can go between different span layers.
This is done by adding a new option **Any span** to the **Attach to layer** setting in the relation layer details.

With this experimental feature, it becomes possible to define multiple annotation layer per span layer. 
If this is the case, the annotation editor will offer a selection list when a new relation is created between two spans to which multiple relation layers could apply.
