[[sect_layers_feature_link]]
= Link features

Link features allow an annotation to connect to one or more span annotations.
Optionally, each of the links may have a role label. 
Link features are for example used to model event structures where the owner of the feature is the event trigger and the spans linked to represent the particpants or circumstances related to the event.

A link feature may be configured to link only to a particular span layer or to any span layer.
When linking to a particular span layer, an armed slot may be filled simply by selecting the span of text to fill it.
An appropriate span annotation will be created automatically.
If the link feature is configured to any layer, an existing span annotation needs to be selected as a slot filler.

.Link feature properties
[cols="1v,2", options="header"]
|====
| Property | Description

| Role labels
| Enabled/disable role labels.

| Comparison
| Determines whether to consider this link feature when comparing the annotations of the layer to which this feature belongs. 

| Multiplicity
| Determines how links are compared to each other e.g. when calulating agreement or when merging annotations during curation.

| Tagset
| The tagset controlling the possible values for the link roles.

| Default slots
| For each of the specificed roles, an empty slot will be visible in the UI. 
  This can save the annotator time to create a slot for frequently used slots.
|====

== Role Labels

Allows users to add a role label to each slot when linking anntations. 
If disabled the UI labels of annotations will be displayed instead of role labels. 
This property is enabled by default.

== Comparison

By default, link features are **ignored when comparing annotations**. 
That means, two annotations at the same position with the same feature values but different links will be considered equal.
If you want to consider the links when comparing annotations, you can change this setting to **consider when comparing annotations**.
Note that even when the links are considered, two annotations at the same position are still considered to be stacked and will not be auto-merge by any merge strategies that do not support stacking.

== Multiplicity

Determines how links are compared to each other e.g. when calulating agreement or when merging annotations during curation.

Use *Each target should be linked in only one role* if you expect that a link target should only appear in a single roles with respect to the same source span - but the same role may be assigned to different targets.
In this mode, if an annotator links the same target in multiple roles, the links will be considered stacked and not be auto-merged by curation or used for agreement calculation.

.When the `slot1` link is merge, the `slot2` link to the same target disappears because each target can only be assigned a single role. The second `slot1` link remains available because it has a different target.

Use *Each Ttrget can be linked in multiple different roles* if a link target can appear in multiple roles with respect to the same source span - but a role may only be used once.
In this mode, if an annotator links multiple targets using the same role, the links will be considered stacked and not be not auto-merged by curation or used for agreement calculation.

.When first link labelled `slot1` is linked, the second `slot1` link disappears because each role can only be assigned to a single target. The `slot2` link remains available because it has a different role.
video::images/ONE_TARGET_MULTIPLE_ROLES.mp4[]

Use *Each target can be linked in multiple roles (same or different)* if you expect that a link target should be linked multiple times with different roles as well as different targets can be linked with the same role.
In this mode, there is no stacking.
Note that the order in which you merge the links and whether you create stacked annotations or not can affect the final result.
