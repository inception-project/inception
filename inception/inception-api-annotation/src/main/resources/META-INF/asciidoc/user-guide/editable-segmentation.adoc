= ðŸ§ª Editable segmentation

====
CAUTION: Experimental feature. To use this functionality, you need to enable it first by adding `ui.sentence-layer-editable=true` to the `settings.properties` file (see the <<admin-guide.adoc#sect_settings_segmentation, Admin Guide>>).
====

Often, after importing a text into {product-name}, one discovers that a segment boundary (e.g. a 
sentence boundary) was not properly recognized or there was a segmentation mistake in the original
data. Normally, such mistakes cannot be corrected. Enabling the experimental 
**editable sentence layer** feature can help in such cases. 

Please note this feature is new and has not been tested a lot in practice yet. There may be
unexpected side effects when manually editing sentences. For example, normally it is expected that:

* the entire text is covered by token and sentence annotations;
* no tokens exist outside sentence boundaries;
* sentences start at a token start boundary and end at a token end boundary.

However, when you enable this feature, you will eventually be able to delete sentences (which leaves
tokens lying around outside sentence boundaries) or create other odd situations which exporters, 
curation, recommenders, editors and other functionalities may not yet be able to deal with. So be
careful, ready to face unexpected situations and make regular backups of course.

Once the feature has been enabled, new projects get a **Sentence** layer. It is also possible to
add a sentence layer to existing project from the dropdown menu of the **create layer** button where
other built-in layers can also be added to a project that does not yet contain them. By default, the
layer is **not enabled** and **read-only** which means that you can neither see the sentence 
annotations in the annotation editor nor create or delete sentence annotations. To make the sentences 
visible and editable for the annotators, check the **enabled** checkbox and un-check the 
**read-only** checkbox and save the layer settings.

While the sentence layer is editable (i.e. enabled and not read-only), the annotation page and the curation page default to a line-oriented editor instead of the usual sentence-oriented editor. In
the line-oriented editor, the sentences can be safely shown and edited because the editor does not
rely on sentence boundaries to control the rendering process. It is then possible to curate the
sentence boundaries.

NOTE: If you start curating a document while the sentence layer is editable but then switch it back
      not being editable, then it could happen that different annotators have different segmentations and/or that the curation
      document does not contain all sentence boundaries. This means that some sentences may be invisible because the 
      the sentence-oriented visualization does not display them!
