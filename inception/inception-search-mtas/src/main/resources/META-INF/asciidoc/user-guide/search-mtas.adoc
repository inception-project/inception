== Mtas search syntax

The {product-name} Mtas search provider allows queries to be executed using CQL (Corpus 
Query Language), as shown in the following examples.
More examples and information about CQL syntax can be found 
at https://meertensinstituut.github.io/mtas/search_cql.html.

When performing queries, the user must reference the annotation types using the layer names, 
as defined in the project schema. In the same way, the features must be referenced using their names 
as defined in the project schema. In both cases, empty spaces in the names must be replaced by 
an underscore. 

Thus, `Lemma` refers to the *Lemma* layer, `Lemma.Lemma` refers to the the *Lemma* feature in the 
*Lemma* layer. In the same way, `Named_entity` refers to *Named entity* layer, and 
`Named_entity.value` refers to the *value* feature in the *Named entity* layer.

Annotations made over single tokens can be queried using the `[...]` syntax, while annotations 
made over multiple tokens must be queried using the `<.../>` syntax. 

In the first case, the user must always provide a feature and a value. The following syntax returns 
all single token annotations of the *LayerX* layer whose *FeatureX* feature have the given value.

 [LayerX.FeatureX="value"]
 
In the second case, the user may or not provide a feature and a value. Thus, the following syntax 
will return all multi-token annotations of the *LayerX* layer, regardless of their features and 
values. 

 <LayerX/>
 
On the other hand, the following syntax will return the multi-token annotations whose *FeatureX* 
feature has the given value.

 <LayerX.FeatureX="value"/>

Notice that the multi-token query syntax can also be used to retrieve single token annotations (e.g.
POS or lemma annotations).

=== Relation layer queries

{product-name} allows queries over relation annotations as well. When relations are indexed, they
are indexed by the position of their target span. That entails that match highlighted in the query
corresponds to text of the target of the relation. 

For the following examples, we assume a span layer called `component` and a relation layer called `rel` attached to it. Both layers have a string feature called `value`.

.Search for rel annotation by feature on the relation
----
<rel.value="foo"/>
----

.Search for rel annotation by the text of the source annotation
----
<rel-source="foo"/>
----

.Search for rel annotation by the text of the target annotation
----
<rel-target="foo"/>
----

.Search for rel annotations by feature on the relation source
----
<rel-source.value="foo"/>
----

.Search for rel annotations by feature on the relation target
----
<rel-target.value="foo"/>
----

.Search for rel annotations by feature on the relation and on the relation target
----
<rel.value="bar"/> fullyalignedwith <rel-target.value="foo"/>
----

.Search for rel annotations by feature on the relation and on the relation source and target
----
<rel.value="bar"/> fullyalignedwith (<rel-source.value="foo"/> fullyalignedwith <rel-target.value="foo"/>)
----

=== Boolean feature queries

The values of boolean features are indexed as `true` and `false`.


=== Concept feature queries

.Generic Search over annotated KB entities : all occurrences for KB entity *Bordeaux*
----
<KB-Entity="Bordeaux"/>
----

The following query returns all mentions of *ChateauMorgonBeaujolais* or any of its subclasses in
the associated knowledge base.

.Named Entity Identifier for KB instance: all mentions of *ChateauMorgonBeaujolais*
----
<Named_entity.identifier="ChateauMorgonBeaujolais"/>
----

Mind that the label of a knowledge base item may be ambiguous, so it may be necessary to search by
IRI.

.Named Entity Identifier for KB instance: all mentions of *ChateauMorgonBeaujolais* by IRI
----
<Named_entity.identifier="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/PR-owl-guide-20031209/wine#ChateauMorgonBeaujolais"/>
----


.Named Entity Identifier : all exact mentions of *ChateauMorgonBeaujolais* .
----
<Named_entity.identifier-exact="ChateauMorgonBeaujolais"/>
----


.OR All exact mentions of either *ChateauMorgonBeaujolais* or *AmericanWine*
---- 
(<Named_entity.identifier-exact="ChateauMorgonBeaujolais"/> | <Named_entity.identifier-exact="AmericanWine"/>)
----
