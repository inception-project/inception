= Project dashboard

Once you have selected a project from the <<sect_projects_list>>, you are taken to this project's
dashboard. 
Depending on the roles that a user has in the project, different functionalities can be accessed from here such as annotation, curation and project configuration.
On the right-hand side of the page, some of the last activities of the user in this project are shown.
The user can click on an activity to resume it e.g. if the user annotated a specific document, the annotation page will be opened on this document.
