          Good day! I seem to have lost my way. 
          Could you perhaps guide me to the lavatory?

          Greetings, Your Highness! 
          I'd be delighted to assist you. 
          Could you tell me where you were last within the castle?

          Thank you, Your Highness. 
          I see that the lavatory is indeed a bit of a distance from the grand hall. 
          I shall connect you with a Castle Attendant who can guide you there directly. 
          Is that agreeable?

          Excellent. 
          Please hold for a moment while I summon a Castle Attendant to guide you. 
          They will be with you shortly.
