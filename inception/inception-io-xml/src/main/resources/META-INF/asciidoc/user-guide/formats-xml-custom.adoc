[[sect_formats_xml_custom]]
= ðŸ§ª Custom XML formats

====
CAUTION: Experimental feature. To use this functionality, you need to enable it first by adding `format.custom-xml.enabled` to the `settings.properties` file.
====

Custom XML document support allows defining own XML annotation formats that can be displayed as formatted documents in HTML-based editors (e.g. the Apache Annotator editor or the RecogitoJS editor). 

The custom XML document support has the goal to provide means of suitably formatting and rendering XML documents in the browser. It does **not** aim at being able to extract potential annotations from the XML document and making them accessible and editable as annotations within {product-name}. It only offers support for **importing** custom XML documents, but not for exporting them. To **export** the annotated document, another format such as <<sect_formats_uimajson>> has to be used. 

Custom XML formats are based on the <<sect_formats_xml>> format support. They are defined by creating a sub-folder `xml-formats` in the application home direcotry. Within that folder, another folder is created for each custom XML format. The name of the folder is used as part of the format identifier. Within this per-format folder, a file called `plugin.json` need to be created with the following content:

.Example `plugin.json` for custom XML format
[source,json]
----
{
  "name": "TTML format (external)",
  "stylesheets": [ 
    "styles.css"
  ],
  "blockElements": [
    "div", "p"
  ],
  "splitSentencesInBlockElements": true
}
----

The `plugin.json` file should define one or more CSS stylesheets that define how elements of the custom XML format should be rendered on screen.

.Example `styles.css` for custom XML format
[source,css]
----
@namespace tt url('http://www.w3.org/ns/ttml');
 
tt|p {
  display: block;
  border-color: gray;
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 1px;
  border-radius: 0.5em;
  margin-top: 0.25em;
  margin-bottom: 0.25em;
}

tt|p::before {
  border-radius: 0.5em 0em 0em 0.5em;
  display: inline-block;
  padding-left: 0.5em;
  padding-right: 0.5em;
  margin-right: 0.5em;
  background-color: lightgray;
  min-width: 10em;
  content: attr(agent) '\a0';
}
----

Additionally, a `policy.yaml` file should be present in the format folder. It defines how the elements of the XML should be handled when rendering the documents for display in the browser.


.Example `policy.yaml` for custom XML format
[source,yaml]
----
name: TTML Content Policies
version: 1.0
policies:
  - elements: [ 
      "{http://www.w3.org/ns/ttml}tt", 
      "{http://www.w3.org/ns/ttml}body", 
      "{http://www.w3.org/ns/ttml}div", 
      "{http://www.w3.org/ns/ttml}p" ]
    action: "PASS"
  - attributes: ["{http://www.w3.org/ns/ttml#metadata}agent"]
    action: "PASS_NO_NS"
----

An example XML file that could be imported with such a format would look like this:

.Example `dialog.xml` file
[source,json]
----
<tt xmlns="http://www.w3.org/ns/ttml" xmlns:ttm="http://www.w3.org/ns/ttml#metadata" xml:lang="en">
  <head>
    <metadata>
      <ttm:agent xml:id="speaker1">Speaker 1</ttm:agent>
      <ttm:agent xml:id="speaker2">Speaker 2</ttm:agent>
    </metadata>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div>
      <p begin="00:00:01.000" end="00:00:05.000" ttm:agent="speaker1">
        Hello, this is the first speaker.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:06.000" end="00:00:10.000" ttm:agent="speaker2">
        And this is the second speaker.
      </p>
    </div>
  </body>
</tt>

NOTE: When exporting a project that contains documents using a custom XML format and importing 
      it into another {product-name} instance in which the format has not been declared, the custom 
      XML documents will not be usable. You will also have to copy the custom format declaration over
      to the new instance. If you use custom XML formats, make sure you keep backups of them
      along with the projects that use them. Also try to use names for your formats that are unlikely to
      clash with others. E.g. `tei` may not be the best name for a custom TEI format support -   
      `project-theater-2000-tei` may be a better name.Â¸
