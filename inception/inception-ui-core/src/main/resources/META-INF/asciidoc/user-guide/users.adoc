= User Management

NOTE: This functionality is only available to *administrators*.

After selecting this functionality, a frame which shows all users is displayed. By selecting a user, a frame is displayed on the right.

Now you may change his role or password, specify  an e-mail address and dis- or enable his account by placing the tick.

NOTE: Disabling an account prevents the user from logging in. The user remains associated with any
      projects and remains visible in the project user management and the project workload management.

To create a new user, click on *Create* in the left frame. This will display a similar frame as the one described in the last paragraph. Here you have to give a login-name to the new user.

In both cases, do not forget to save your changes by pressing the *Save* button.
