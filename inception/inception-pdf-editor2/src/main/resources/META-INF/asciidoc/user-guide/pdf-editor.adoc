# PDF Annotation Editor

The PDF annotation editor allows annotating text in PDF files. Usually, it opens automatically when
opening a PDF file.

To annotate a span, simply mark the span with the mouse. When you press the left mouse button and
drag the mouse, a  highlight should appear. When you release the mouse button, the annotation
should be created. 

NOTE: If no highlight appears, then the PDF may not include text information at this location. You 
      may try verifying if the text can be selected in other PDF-enabled tools like macOS Preview or Acrobat
      Reader. {product-name} can only work with PDFs that include text information. If a PDF was OCRed, the
      text may not always be at the same location as you see it on screen. Try marking a larger region to 
      see if you can "catch" it.
      
A span annotation is rendered as a highlight with a small knob hovering above the start of the 
highlight. To select the annotation click on that knob. If the knob overlaps with another 
highlight, it might be hard to see. If you move the mouse over it, the knob reacts - that may help
you find it. If there are multiple annotations starting at the same position, their knobs are stacked.

To create a relation, press the left mouse button on the knob and drag the mouse over to the
knob of another span annotation.
