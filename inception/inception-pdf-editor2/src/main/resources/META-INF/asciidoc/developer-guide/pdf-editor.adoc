# PDF Annotation Editor

The PDF-Editor module allows the view and annotation of PDF documents. 

The module consists of several parts:

* the `VisualPdfReader` is using _pdfbox_  to extract the text from the PDF files. During this process,
  it keeps track of the positions of each glyph (the "visual model") and also includes this 
  information as annotations  in the CAS. The `org.dkpro.core.api.pdf.type.PdfPage` type encodes 
  information about page boundaries while the `org.dkpro.core.api.pdf.type.PdfChunk` type encodes 
  information about short sequences of glyphs that have the same orientation and script direction 
  (typically belonging to the same word).

* the `PdfDocumentFrameView` is using _pdf.js_ to display the PDF file in the browser. It provides
  endpoints for the browser to access the PDF as well as for obtaining the visual model.
  
* the `PdfAnnotationEditor` which builds on the `PdfDocumentFrameView` and includes the client-side
  JavaScript code (loosely based on _PDFAnno_). For the communication of the editor with the 
  backend, the INCEpTION JS editor API (DIAM) is used.
