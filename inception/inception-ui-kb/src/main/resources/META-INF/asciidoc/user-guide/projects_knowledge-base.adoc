= Knowledge Bases

[.i7n-assistant]
--
Knowledge bases contain concepts that annotations can be linked to.
Often, they contain a controlled vocabulary or ontology that is used to disambiugate the meaning of the annotations.
An example use-case is the linking of named entities to a knowledge base such as WikiData.
Another example is the linking of concepts in a text to a domain-specific ontology such as the Human Phenotype Ontology.

In the *Projects Settings*, switch to the *Knowledge Bases* tab, then click *New…* on the bottom
 and a dialogue box shows as in the figure below.

To create a *local* or *remote*  knowledge base, one needs to choose *Local* or *Remote* for the type. 
For the reification, *NONE* is the default case, but to support qualifiers, one needs to choose *WIKIDATA*. 

For the local KB, you can optionally choose a RDF file from which to import the initial data. 
Alternatively, you can skip the step to create an empty KB to create a knowledge base from scratch. 
It is also always possible to import data from an RDF file after the creation of a KB. 
It is also possible to multiple RDF files into the same KB, one after another.

For remote KBs, INCEpTION provides the user with some pre-configured knowledge base such as WikiData, British Museum, BabelNet, DBPediaa or Yago.
You can also set up a custom remote KB, in which case the user needs to provide the SPARQL endpoint URL for the knowledge base as in the figure below.

== Settings

There are various settings for knowledge bases.

[.thumb]
image::images/kb3.png[align="center"]

=== Local KBs

* **Read only:** Whether the KB can be modified. This setting is disabled by default.
  Enabling it prevents making changes to the KB and allows for more effective query caching.

=== Remote KBs

The remote knowledge bases, there are the following settings:

* **SPARQL endpoint URL:** The SPARQL URL used to access the knowledge base
* **Skip SSL certificate checks:** Enable to skip the verification of SSL certificates. This can
  help if the remote server is using a self-signed certificate. It should be avoided to use this
  option in production. Instead, better install the remote certificate into your Java environment
  so it can be validated. 
* **Default dataset:** A SPARQL endpoint may server multiple datasets. This setting can be used to
  restrict queries to a specific one. Consult with the operator of the SPARQL server to see which
  datasets are available.

NOTE: **Changing the URL of a remote KB currently only takes affect after {product-name} is restarted!**
      The updated URL will be shown in the settings, but queries will still be sent to the old URL until you restart {product-name}.
      This also means that if you add, remove or change HTTP "Basic" authentication that are part of the URL, they will not
      take effect until you restart. It is usually easier to delete the remote KB configuration and create it from scratch
      with the new URL.


=== Query settings

* **Use fuzzy matching:** enables fuzzy matching when searching the knowledge base. The effect is
  slightly different depending on the backend being used and it can **significantly slow down** the
  retrieval process. It is normally a good idea to leave this feature off. If you would like to 
  retrieve items from the knowledge base which only approximately match a query (e.g. you would 
  like that an entry `John` is matched if you enter `Johan` or vice versa), then you could try
  this out. 
* **Result limit for SPARQL queries:** this is used to limit the amount of data retrieved from the
  remote server, e.g when populating dropdown boxes for concept search.


=== Schema mapping

Different types of knowledge base schemata are supported via a configurable mapping mechanism. The
user can choose one of the pre-configured mapping or provide a custom mapping.

=== Root Concepts

The knowledge base browser displays a class tree.
By default, it tries to automatically determine the root classes of this tree.
However, for very large KBs this can be slow. Also you might not be interested in browsing the entire KB but would rather focus on specific subtrees.
In such cases, you can define the root concepts explicitly here.

NOTE: This setting currently affects **only class tree in the knowledge base browser**.
      You can still search for concepts that are outside of the subtrees induced by the root concepts using the search field on the knowledge-base page and you can also still link concept features to concepts outside the subtrees. 
      In order to limit a concept feature to a particular subtree, use the **Scope** setting in the <<sect_concept_features,concept feature settings>>.


=== Additional Matching Properties (Synonyms)

When searching for a concept e.g. in the annotation editor, by default the search terms are matched only against the concept name (label).
There should only be one label for each concept (although there can be multiple label entries for a concept in the knowledge base, but theses should refer to different languages).
However, it is common that this one label is actually only the preferred label and there could be any number of synonyms through which the concept can also be found.
Thus, here you can enter a list of properties which should also be considered when searching for a concept.

NOTE: Not all remote SPARQL knowledge bases may support additional matching properties. 
      If a full text index is used (recommended!), then the full text index may have to be configured to index 
      all properties listed here.
 
=== Full text search

Full text search in knowledge bases enables searching for entities by their textual context, e.g. their label. This is a prerequisite for some advanced features such as re-ranking linking candidates during entity linking. 

Unfortunately, the SPARQL standard does not define a uniform way to perform full text searches. {product-name} offers support for full text search in a broad range of backend servers supporting the SPARQL protocol.

.Supported full text search backends
* link:https://franz.com/agraph/support/documentation/current/text-index.html[AllegroGraph]
* link:https://jena.apache.org/documentation/query/text-query.html[Apache Jena Fuseki]
* link:https://github.com/blazegraph/database/wiki/FullTextSearch[Blazegraph DB]
* link:https://rdf4j.org/documentation/programming/lucene/[RDF4J Lucene]
* link:https://docs.stardog.com/query-stardog/full-text-search[Stardog]
* link:https://docs.openlinksw.com/virtuoso/rdfsparqlrulefulltext/[Virtuoso]
* link:https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Wikidata_Query_Service/User_Manual/MWAPI[Wikidata (MediaWiki API Query Service EntitySearch)]

If you select an FTS support that does not match the SPARQL server you are connecting to, you will likely get errors.
If you are not sure, select **Unknown** to fall back to using standard SPARQL operations only - this will be very slow though and unviable for larger knowledge bases.

==== Apache Jena Fuseki

To enable the full text index on the Fuseki server side, set the options options `text:storeValues` and
`text:multilingualSupport` both to `true` (cf. link:https://jena.apache.org/documentation/query/text-query.html[Text Dataset Assembler documentation]).

Fuseki databases are usually accessible via SPARQL at `http://localhost:3030/DATABASE-NAME/sparql` or
`http://localhost:3030/DATABASE-NAME/query`.

==== Stardog

To enable full text search in a Stardog database, create the database with the option 
`search.enabled=true`.

.Example creation of FTS-enabled Stardog database
----
stardog-admin db create -n DATABASE-NAME -o search.enabled=true -- knowledgebase.ttl
----

Stardog databases are usually accessible via SPARQL at `http://localhost:5820/DATABASE-NAME/query`.
You may have to specify credentials as part of the URL to gain access.

==== SPARQL Endpoint Authentication

{product-name} supports endpoints require authentication.
The following authentication mechanisms are supported.

* HTTP basic authentication
* OAuth (client credentials)

To enable authentication, select one of the options from the **Authentication** dropdown menu.

NOTE: To protect you credentials while sending them to the remote side, it is strongly recommended
      to use a HTTPS connection to the SPARQL endpoint and keep SSL certificate checking enabled.

.HTTP "basic" authentication
This is a simple mechanism that sends a username and password on every request. 

.OAuth (client credentials) authentication
This mechanism uses the client ID and client secret to obtain an authentication token which is then
used for subsequent requests. Once the token expires, a new token is requested.

====
CAUTION: Legacy feature. It is also possible to use HTTP basic authentication by prefixing the 
      SPARQL URL with the username and password (`http://USERNAME:PASSWORD@localhost:5820/mock/query`). 
      However, this is not recommended. For example, the password will be visible to anybody being able to access the knowledge base settings.
      This option is only supported for backwards compatibility and will be removed in future versions.
====

=== Importing RDF

NOTE: You can only import data into local KBs. Remote KBs are always read-only.

KBs can be populated by importing RDF files. Several formats are supported.
The type of the file is determined by the file extension.
So make sure the files have the correct extension when you import them, otherwise nothing might be imported from them despite a potentially long waiting time.
The application supports GZIP compressed files (ending in `.gz`, so e.g. `.ttl.gz`), so we recommend compressing the files before uploading them as this can significantly improve the import time due to a reduced transfer time across the network.
