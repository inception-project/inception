= Recommenders

Recommenders provide annotation support by predicting potential labels. 
These can be either accepted or rejected by the user. 
A recommender learns from this interaction to further improve the quality of its predictions.

Recommenders are trained every time an annotation is created, updated or deleted. In order to determine 
whether the annotations are good enough, recommenders are evaluated on the annotation data.
During recommender evaluation a score for each recommender is calculated and if this score does not
meet the configured threshold, the recommender will not be used.

Recommenders can be configured in the *Project Settings* under the *Recommenders* tab. To create a new
recommender, click *Create*. Then, the layer, feature and the classifier type has to be selected.

== Overall recommender settings

The option **wait for suggestions from non-trainable recommenders when opening document** can be
enabled overall. It is accessible from the settings dropdown on the recommender list panel.
When this option is enabled, the system will wait for responses from all non-trainable recommenders
in the project when a user is opening a document before actually displaying the document to the
user. If this option is not checked, then recommendations may only appear after the user has 
performed some action such as creating an annotation.

NOTE: Enable this option only if all of your non-trainable recommenders have a fast response time,
      as otherwise your users may complain about a long delay when opening documents.

The option **show suggestions when viewing annotations from another user** configures whether to display annotation
suggestions when viewing annotations from another user (e.g. as project manager, you can select to view annotations from
any annotator in the open document dialog).

== Per-recommender settings

By default, the name of new recommenders are auto-generated based on the choice of layer, feature and tool. However, you can deactivate this behavior by unchecking the *auto-generate* option next to the name field.

Recommenders can be enabled and disabled. This behaviour is configured by the *Enabled* checkbox.
Recommenders that are disabled are not used for training and prediction and are not evaluated.

The *Activation strategy* describes when a recommender should be used for prediction. Right now,
there are two options: either set a threshold on the evaluation score (if the evaluation score is
lower than the threshold, the recommender is not used for predicting until annotations have changed)
or always enable it. 
If the option *Always active* is disabled and the score threshold is set to 0, 
the recommender will also be always executed, but internally it is still evaluated.

Some recommenders are capable of generating multiple alternative suggestions per token or span. The maximum
number of suggestions can be configured by the *Max. recommendations* field.

Sometimes it is desirable to not train on all documents, but only on e.g. finished documents. In order
to control documents in which state should be used for training, the respective ones can be selected
from the *States used for training*.

To save a recommender, click *Save*. To abort, click *Cancel*. To edit an existing recommender, it
can be selected from the left pane, edited and then saved. Recommenders can be deleted by clicking on
*Delete*. This also removes all predictions by this recommender.

NOTE: *Stacked annotations*: If you configured a recommender on a layer that allows stacking (i.e. multiple annotations of the same layer type at the same position in the text), accepting a suggestion will always create a new annotation with the suggested feature value. Even if annotation(s) of the same type already exist at this position, the suggested feature value will not be added to this annotation, but a new one will be created instead.
