= Opening a Document for Annotation

When navigating to the *Annotation* page, a dialogue opens that allows you to select the document you want to annotate.
If you want to access this dialog later, use the *Open* button in the action bar.

The keyboard focus is automatically placed into the search field when the dialog opens.
You can use it to conveniently search for documents by name.
The table below is automatically filtered according to your input.
If only one document is left, you can press kbd:[ENTER] to open it.
Otherwise, you can click on a document in the table to open it.
The *Filter* buttons allow to filter the table by document state.

Users that are managers can additionally open other users' documents to view their annotations but cannot change them.
This is down via the *User* dropdown menu.
The user's own name is listed at the top and marked _(me)_.
