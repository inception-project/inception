= Chains

A chain layer includes both, span and relation annotations, into a single structural layer. Creating
a span annotation in a chain layer basically creates a chain of length one. Creating a relation
between two chain elements has different effects depending on whether the *linked list* behavior
is enabled for the chain layer or not. To enable or disable the *linked list* behaviour, go to *Layers*
in the *Projects Settings* mode. After choosing *Coreference*, *linked list* behaviour
is displayed in the checkbox and can either be marked or unmarked.

To abort the creation of an annotation, hold *CTRL* when you release the mouse button.

.Chain behavior
|====
| Linked List | Condition | Result

| disabled
| the two spans are already in the same chain
| nothing happens

| disabled
| the two spans are in different chains
| the two chains are merged

| enabled
| the two spans are already in the same chains
| the chain will be re-linked such that a chain link points from the source to the target span, 
  potentially creating new chains in the process.

| enabled
| the two spans are in different chains
| the chains will be re-linked such that a chain link points from the source to the target span, 
  merging the two chains and potentially creating new chains from the remaining prefix and suffix
  of the original chains.
