[[sect_formats_conll2012]]
= CoNLL 2012

The CoNLL 2012 format targets semantic role labeling and coreference. Columns are whitespace-separated (tabs or spaces). Sentences are separated by a blank new line.

Note that this format cannot deal with the following situations:
* An annotation has no label (e.g. a `SemPred` annotation has no category) - in such a case `null` is
  written into the corresponding column. However, the reader will actually read this value as the
  label.
* If a `SemPred` annotation is at the same position as a `SemArg` annotation linked to it, then only
  the `(V*)` representing the `SemPred` annotation will be written.
* `SemPred` annotations spanning more than one token are not supported
* If there are multiple `SemPred` annotations on the same token, then only one of them is written.
  This is because the `category` of the `SemPred` annotation goes to the  **Predicate Frameset ID** 
  and that can only hold one value which.

.Columns
[cols="1,2,3", options="header"]
|====
| Column  | Type/Feature | Description

| Document ID
| ignored
| This is a variation on the document filename.</li>

| Part number
| ignored
| Some files are divided into multiple parts numbered as 000, 001, 002, ... etc.

| Word number
| ignored
| 

| Word itself
| document text
|  This is the token as segmented/tokenized in the Treebank. Initially the `*_skel` file contain the placeholder `[WORD]` which gets replaced by the actual token from the Treebank which is part of the OntoNotes release.

| Part-of-Speech
| POS
| 

| Parse bit
| ignored
| This is the bracketed structure broken before the first open parenthesis in the parse, and the word/part-of-speech leaf replaced with a `*`. The full parse can be created by substituting the asterisk with the `([pos] [word])` string (or leaf) and concatenating the items in the rows of that column.

| Predicate lemma
| Lemma
|  The predicate lemma is mentioned for the rows for which we have semantic role information. All other rows are marked with a `-`.

| Predicate Frameset ID
| SemPred
| This is the PropBank frameset ID of the predicate in Column 7.

| Word sense
| ignored
| This is the word sense of the word in Column 3.

| Speaker/Author
| ignored
| This is the speaker or author name where available. Mostly in Broadcast Conversation and Web Log data.

| Named Entities
| NamedEntity
| These columns identifies the spans representing various named entities.

| Predicate Arguments
| SemPred
| There is one column each of predicate argument structure information for the predicate mentioned in Column 7.

| Coreference
| CoreferenceChain
| Coreference chain information encoded in a parenthesis structure.
