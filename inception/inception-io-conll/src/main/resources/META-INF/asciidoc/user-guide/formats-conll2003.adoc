[[sect_formats_conll2003]]
= CoNLL 2003

The CoNLL 2003 format encodes named entity spans and chunk spans. Fields are separated by a single
space. Sentences are separated by a blank new line. Named entities and chunks are encoded in the
IOB1 format. I.e. a `B` prefix is only used if the category of the following span differs from the
category of the current span.
