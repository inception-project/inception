     * Parser configuration for reading RDF into a knowledge base.
     * <p>
     * RDF4J 5.3.2 hardened its XML parsers against XXE (follow-up to CVE-2018-1000644) and as part
     * of that started rejecting {@code DOCTYPE} declarations outright. That is too strict for us:
     * many OWL vocabularies - OLIA being the one our own tests trip over - declare <b>internal</b>
     * entities in a {@code DOCTYPE} purely to abbreviate namespace IRIs, and those files must
     * remain importable.
     * <p>
     * So we accept the {@code DOCTYPE} declaration again, but only that. Every setting that would
     * make the parser reach outside the document stays off, and it is the outside reach - not the
     * declaration - that constitutes the XXE risk: no external general entities, no external
     * parameter entities, no external DTD loading, and XML secure processing stays enabled.
     * <p>
     * Apply this per import operation. Do not turn {@code DISALLOW_DOCTYPE_DECL} off globally.
     *
     * @return a parser configuration tolerating internal {@code DOCTYPE} entity declarations while
     *         keeping all external entity resolution disabled.
