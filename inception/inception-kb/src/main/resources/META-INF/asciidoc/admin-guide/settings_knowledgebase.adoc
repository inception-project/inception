= Knowledge Base Settings

This section describes the global settings related to the knowledge base module.

.Default max results
This parameter determines the default value for the maximum number of results that can be retrieved from a SPARQL query.
The queries are used to retrieve concepts, statements, properties, etc. from the knowledge base.
The maximum number of results can also be configured separately for each knowledge base in the project settings.

.Hard max results
A hard limit for the *Max results* parameter.

If no value for the parameter is specified, its default value is used.
The default value is shown as an example of how the parameter can be configured below:

NOTE: Disabling the knowledge base support will lead to the loss of concept linked features from
      documents/projects that were using them. 
      If you wish to run the application without knowledge base support, it is strongly recommended to disable the feature immediately after the installation and not after any projects have potentially started using it.
