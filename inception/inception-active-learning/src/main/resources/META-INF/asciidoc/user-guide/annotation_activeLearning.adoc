= Active Learning

[.i7n-assistant]
--
The Active Learning feature in {product-name} is designed to help users annotate documents more efficiently.
It tries to optimize the learning rate of classification algorithms by asking the user to disambiguate uncertain cases.
Unlike many other active learning systems, {product-name} allows the user interact with the annotation editor normally even during an active learning session - i.e. the user can create annotations, set features, etc. without interrupting the active learning process.
Active learning is only available for layers that have recommenders configured and requires the recommenders to provide scores for their suggestions.
--

== Starting an Active Learning Session

1. Open the Active Learning sidebar on the left of the screen.
2. Choose from a list of all layers for which recommenders have been configured.
3. Start an active learning session on the selected layer.

== Reviewing Annotation Suggestions

The system will start showing recommendations one by one, according to the <<developer-guide.adoc#sect_activeLearning_uncertaintySampling,uncertainty sampling>> learning strategy.
The recommendation is also highlighted in the central annotation editor.
For each recommendation, the following information is displayed:

- **Text**: The annotated text.
- **Label**: The annotation suggested by the system - you may change this label if it is incorrect.
- **Score**: The confidence score of the recommendation.
- **Delta**: The difference between the given score and the closest score calculated for another suggestion made by the same recommender.

== Actions on Annotation Suggestions

You can perform the following actions on each recommendation in the Active Learning sidebar:
- **Annotate**: Accept the recommendation.
- **Reject**: Reject the recommendation.
- **Skip**: Skip the recommendation without taking any action.

When using the _Annotate_, _Reject_, or _Skip_ buttons, the system automatically jumps to the next suggestion for you to inspect.
However, at times it may be necessary to go back to a recently inspected suggestion to review it.

Suggestions that are skipped disappear at first.
However, once all other suggestions have been processed, the system asks whether the skipped suggestions should now be reviewed.
Accepting will remove all skipped items from the history (even those that might no longer be visible in the history because of its on-screen size limit).

== History Panel

The *History* panel shows the 50 most recent actions.
Clicking on the text of an item loads it in the main annotation editor.
It is also possible to delete items from the history, e.g. wrongly rejected items.

The history panel displays whether a given suggestion was accepted, corrected or rejected, but this information can only be indicative.
It represents a snapshot of the moment where the user made the choice. As the recommender is continuously updated by the system, the suggestions constantly change.
It may happen that a suggestion which is shown as _rejected_ in the sidebar is at a later time not even generated anymore by the recommender.
Thus, deleting an item from the history will not always cause the suggestion from which it was generated to reappear.
Resetting a document also clears the Active Learning history.

When removing an accepted/corrected item from the history and the annotation which was generated from this item is still present (i.e. it has not been deleted by other means), the user is asked whether the associated annotation should also be deleted.

== Using the Main Annotation Editor while in Active Learning

{product-name} allows the user to create annotations as usual in the main annotation editor panel, even when in an Active Learning session.
However, there is only a limited interaction with actions performed in the main annotation editor. If a suggestion is accepted or rejected in the main annotation editor, this is recorded in the history.
However, if a user manually creates an annotation which causes a suggestion to disappear by overlapping with it, the history does not record this as a correction.
For example, if the system generates a suggestion for `Paul.` (including the final sentence punctuation) but the user manually creates an annotation only for `Paul` (without the punctuation), the system does not recognize it as a correction.

Accepting/correcting, rejecting and skipping a suggestion in the sidebar cause the main annotation editor to move to the next suggestion.
However, when a suggestion is accepted or rejected via the main editor, the generated annotation is opened in the annotation detail editor panel on the right side and the editor does not move to the next suggestion.
For actions made in the main editor, it is assumed that the user may want to perform additional actions (e.g. set features, create more annotations in the vicinity) - jumping to the next suggestion would interfere with such intentions.
That said, the next suggestion is loaded in the active learning sidebar and the user can jump to it by clicking on the suggestion text in the sidebar.
