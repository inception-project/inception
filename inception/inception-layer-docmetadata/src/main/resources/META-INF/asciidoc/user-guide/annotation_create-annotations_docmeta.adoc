= Document-level annotations

Before being able to configure document-level annotations, you need to define an annotation layer of 
type *Document metadata* on the project *Settings*, *Layers* tab. For this:

* Go to *Settings -> Layers* and click the *Create* button
* Enter a name for the annotation layer (e.g. `Author`) and set its type to *Document metadata*
* Click *Save*
* On the right side of the page, you can now configure features for this annotation layer by clicking *Create*
* Again, choose a name and type for the feature e.g. `name` of type *Primitive: String*
* Click *Save*

On the annotation page, you can now:

* Open the **Document Metadata sidebar** (the tags icon) and
* Choose the newly created annotation layer in the dropdown.
* Clicking the plus sign will add a new annotation whose feature you can fill in.

NOTE: Curation of document-level annotations is not possible. Import and export of document-level
annotations is only supported in the UIMA CAS XMI and UIMA CAS JSON formats.

== Singletons

If you want to define a document metadata layer for which each document should have exactly one
annotation, then you can mark the layer as a *singleton*. This means that in every document, an
annotation of this type is automatically created when the annotator opens the document. It is
immediately accessible via the document metadata sidebar - the annotator does not have to create
it first. Also, the singleton annotation cannot be deleted.
