              This usage data collector helps the developer team of
              <wicket:message key="product.name" />
              discover the number of installations and the size of the user base. These are
              important indicators for the success of the product and are e.g. included in reports
              to funders. Please support the future development of
              <wicket:message key="product.name" />
              by submitting these <b>anonymous usage statistics</b> to the developers at UKP Lab,
              Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany.
            </p>
            <p>
              When enabled, the anonymous usage statistics are sent to our server every time the 
              application is started and immediately when turning the collection on here. Also,
              an update is sent in regular intervals for long-running instances.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>NOTE:</b> This collector does <b>not</b> collect any data from users (e.g. 
              annotators) logging into the system. It does, however, collect the number of enabled
              user accounts in the server since that is important for assessing the size of the
              user base for a multi-user capable system such as 
              <wicket:message key="product.name" />.
