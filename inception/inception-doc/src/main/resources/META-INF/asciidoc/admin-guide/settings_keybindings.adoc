= Keyboard shortcuts

[IMPORTANT]
====
Keyboard shortcuts should always include modifier keys (kbd:[Ctrl], kbd:[Shift], kbd:[Alt]) to:

* Work properly even when focus is in input fields (modifier keys prevent conflicts with normal typing)
* Avoid conflicts with standard browser shortcuts (e.g., use kbd:[Ctrl + y] instead of just kbd:[y])
====

Keyboard shortcuts are specified as comma-separated key names (e.g., `Ctrl,z` for kbd:[Ctrl + Z]).
Available key names include: 

* Modifier keys: `Ctrl`, `Shift`, `Alt`, `Meta`;
* Arrow keys: `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`;
* Function keys: `F1` through `F12`;
* Special keys: `Enter`, `Escape`, `Delete`, `Backspace`, `Tab`, `Space`, `Page_up`, `Page_down`, `Home`, `End`, `Insert`;
* regular character keys: `a` through `z`, `zero` through `nine`.

By default, most key bindings are active even if the focus is on an input field.
However, if you e.g. want to bind some function e.g. to kbd:[Shift + 2], that could easily prevent you from `"` into e.g. the search field.
Thus, you can disable individual key bindings while the focus is in an input field or text area:

.Disable specific keyboard shortcuts when focus is in input field
```
ui.keybindings.anchoring-mode.singleToken.keys=Shift,two
ui.keybindings.anchoring-mode.singleToken.disabled-in-inputs=true
```
