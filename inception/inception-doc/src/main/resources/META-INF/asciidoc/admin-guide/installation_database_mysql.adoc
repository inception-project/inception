= MySQL

The preferred database for use with {product-name} is MariaDB. However, MariaDB and MySQL are largely compatible and in some environments, MariaDB may not be readily available. Thus, here you can find some additonal information specific to deploying {product-name} using a MySQL database. Note that this section does not repeat all the setup instructions from the MariaDB section - the setup please refer to the MariaDB section first. This section only describes additional items specific to MySQL.

== Using the MySQL JDBC driver

{product-name} only includes the MariaDB JDBC driver. According to the MariaDB documentation, this driver is also compatible with MySQL servers. However, additional settings may be necessary when connecting to a MySQL server.

If you want to use {product-name} with MySQL instead of MariaDB, you may also have to explicitly define the database driver. The MariaDB driver should also work for MySQL databases, but if you use a `mysql` JDBC URL (like e.g. `jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/inception`), you need to explicitly define the driver in the `settings.properties` file:

----
database.driver=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver
----

In most cases, {product-name} can auto-configure the database dialect to use. However, in some cases, this auto-detection may fail - in particular when using MySQL. For example, when using INCEpTION with MySQL 8, it may be necessary to explicitly add a database dialect configuration to the `settings.properties` file:

----
database.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL8Dialect
----

Finally, recent versions of MySQL may need this setting to avoid schema validation to fail during startup:

----
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.globally_quoted_identifiers=true
----

== JDBC driver options

Depending yon your environment, you might have to add additional options to the JDBC URL, e.g.

----
sslMode=REQUIRED
----
