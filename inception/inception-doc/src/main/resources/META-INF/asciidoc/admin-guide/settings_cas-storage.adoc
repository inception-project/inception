[[sect_settings_cas_storage]]
= CAS storage

This section describes settings related to the storage of CAS data objects (i.e. annotations).

.CAS cache settings in the `settings.properties` file
[cols="4*", options="header"]
|===
| Setting
| Description
| Default
| Example

| `cas-storage.compressed-cas-serialization`
| Whether to compress annotation files
| `true`
| `false`

| `cas-storage.file-system-timestamp-accuracy`
| For file systems where timestamps are not exact, this can be used to configure some leniency. This setting should be used with extreme caution. If an editor accesses an annotation file that is out-of-sync with the editor, this can lead to unexpected behavior. However, when deploying {product-name} e.g. on certain cloud storage facilitites, the file system timestamps may not be exact down to the millisecond,
this it may be helpful to configure a slight leniency here.
| `0`
| `500ms`
|===

The compression setting takes effect whenever a CAS is written to disk. Changing it does not 
immediately (de)compress existing CAS files. Instead, they will be slowly converted to being
(de)compressed over time as they are updated by the system as part of normal operations.

== CAS cache

To speed up interactions, {product-name} keeps a cache annotation data in memory. 
This cache can be tuned using the following properties:

.CAS cache settings in the `settings.properties` file
[cols="4*", options="header"]
|===
| Setting
| Description
| Default
| Example

| `cas-storage.cache.shared-cas-cache-size`
| Number of shared read-only CASes to keep in memory
| `10`-`5000` _(depending on heap size)_
| `20000`

| `cas-storage.cache.idle-cas-eviction-delay`
| Periodic interval in which the system should check if CASes can be removed from the memory cache
| `5m`
| `30s`

| `cas-storage.cache.min-idle-cas-time`
| Time a CAS should at least remain cached in memory to avoid loading from disk
| `5m`
| `30s`

| `cas-storage.cache.cas-borrow-wait-timeout`
| Time for an exclusive action to wait for another exclusive action to finish
| `3m`
| `5m`
