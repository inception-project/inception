= Project life cycle

The following image shows the typical life-cycle of an annotation project in {product-name}.

image::images/progress_workflow.jpg[align="center"]

Initially, the **project manager** sets up the project.
This includes defining the annotation scheme and the annotation guidelines, uploading the documents, and adding annotators.
If the manager wants to delegate the task of quality control to another person, they can also add a curator.
The process of setting up and managing a project are further described in <<sect_projects>>.

Once the project has been set up, it is the time for the **annotators** to start their work.
They log in to the system and start annotating the documents according to the guidelines.
When an annotator is done with a document, they mark it as _Finished_ to indicate that it can be reviewed by the curator.

During the project **curator** (often the same person who is also the **project manager**) control the progress and quality of the project via the <<sect_workload>> and <<sect_agreement>> functionalities.
When a document has been fully annotated, the curator may review and adjudicate the annotations using the <<sect_curation>> functionality.
When the curator is has adjudicated a document, they also mark the document as _Finished_.

Once all documents have been fully adjudicated, the entire project is considered _Finished_.
The **project manager** then typically exports the annotations and documents for further processing.
