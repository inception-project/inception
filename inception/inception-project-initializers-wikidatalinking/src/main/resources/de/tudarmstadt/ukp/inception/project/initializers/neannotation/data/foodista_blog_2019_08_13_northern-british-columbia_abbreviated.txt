Northern British Columbia: Small Town Charm, Big Time Adventure

Mountain ranges surround this quaint town of Smithers, population under 6000. 
If you come by plane from Vancouver British Columbia Canada, it is a 1.5-hour flight to the northwest. 
Alternatively, perhaps you prefer to enjoy the scenic Great Northern Circle Route.

Cold beverage? Smithers Brewing is the logical first stop for some refreshment. 
The three founders of the brewery all have local roots and love the area so much that they found it easy to leave steady jobs to start the brewery. 
First up was the Last Cast Lager, a Munich Helles (German for light/bright) with a light golden color and a pleasant crisp, complex taste. 
ISA, not IPA? That was a great surprise. 
The Hudson Bay ISA (India Session Ale) is less hoppy and has less alcohol than the more common IPA. 
Next tasting was the Strawberry Rhubarb Pie Blond, a perfect summer brew - a lovely light fruit nose and a blonde type of finish. 
Last up was the Coffee Lager and, if one were so inclined, this might be an excellent starter for breakfast paired with an omelet - the right balance between coffee and lager. 
My favorite was the Last Cast Lager, but I'm biased to lagers. 
Smithers Brewing is part of the BC Ale Trail, and we could have happily done more tasting, but dinner time was upon us.
