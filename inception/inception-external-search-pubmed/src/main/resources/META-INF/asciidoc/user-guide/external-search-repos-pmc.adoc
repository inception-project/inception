CAUTION: Experimental feature. To use this functionality, you need to enable it first by adding `external-search.pmc.enabled=true` to the `settings.properties` file (see the <<admin-guide.adoc#sect_settings, Admin Guide>>). You should also add `format.bioc.enabled=true` to enable
support for the BioC format used by this repository connector.
====

link:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/[PubMed Central]Â® (PMC) is a free full-text archive of biomedical and life sciences journal literature at the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicine (NIH/NLM). It can be added as an external document repository by
selecting the **PubMed Central** repository type.

NOTE: {product-name} uses the BioC version of the PMC documents for import. This is only available for 
      Open Access texts. {product-name} automatically adds a filter for open access results (`"open access"[filter]`) 
      to the query. The BioC version of these texts may be available only with a delay {product-name} automatically 
      excludes results that were published in the last 24h to try to keep the number of non-importable results low. 
      If you are still unable to import a result, try a bit later.
