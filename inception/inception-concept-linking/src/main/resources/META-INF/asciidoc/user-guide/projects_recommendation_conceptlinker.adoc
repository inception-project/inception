== Named Entity Linker

This recommender can be used with concept features on span layers. It does not learn from training
data, but instead attempts to match the context of the entity mention in the text with the context
of candidate entities in the knowledge base and suggests the highest ranked candidate entities. 
In order for this recommender to function, it is necessary that the knowledge base configured for
the respective concept feature supports full text search.
