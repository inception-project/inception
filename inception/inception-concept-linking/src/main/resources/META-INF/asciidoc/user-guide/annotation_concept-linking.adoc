= Concept Linking

Concept Linking is the task of identifying concept mentions in the text and linking them to their
corresponding concepts in a knowledge base.
Use cases of Concept Linking are commonly found in the area of biomedical text mining, e.g.
to facilitate understanding of unexplained terminology or abbreviations in scientific literature by
linking biological entities.

== Contextual Disambiguation

Concept names can be ambiguous. There can be potentially many different concepts
having the same name (consider the large number of famous people called John Smith). Thus, it is
helpful to rank the candidates before showing them to the user in the annotation interface. If the
ranking works well, the user can quickly choose on of the top-ranking candidates instead of having
to scroll through a long list.

To link a concept mention to the knowledge base, first select the mention annotation, then select
the concept feature in the right sidebar of the annotation editor and start typing the name of
a concept. A ranked list of candidates is then displayed in the form of a drop-down menu.
In order to make the disambiguation process easier, descriptions are shown for each candidate.

The suggestions are updated every time it receives new input.

== Automated Concept Suggestions

The Named Entity Linker (NEL) displays three highest-ranked candidates as suggestions boxes
over each mention annotated as Named Entity.
The user can accept, reject or ignore these suggestions.
If a suggestion is rejected, it is not showed again.
It is possible to combine the NEL with the existing Named Entity Recommenders for the NE type,
which makes the annotation process even faster.
The recommender needs to be set up in the <<sect_projects_recommendation, Project Settings>>.
