= ðŸª¦ TEI P5 XML (old)

The link:https://tei-c.org/guidelines/p5/[TEI P5 XML] format is a widely used standard format. It is a very complex format and furthermore is often extended for specific corpora. 

{product-name} supports importing annotations from various common element types, but by far not all. For more details about the supported element types, see the link:https://dkpro.github.io/dkpro-core/releases/2.2.0/docs/format-reference.html#format-Tei[DKPro Core TEI support] documentation.

When importing TEI files using this format, the XML structure of the document is **not** retained. When exporting an annotated document in this format, the XML structure is generated from scratch.
