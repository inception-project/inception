[[sect_formats_tei_legacy]]
= TEI P5 XML (legacy)

The link:https://tei-c.org/guidelines/p5/[TEI P5 XML] format is a widely used standard format. It is a very complex format and furthermore is often extended for specific corpora. 

{product-name} supports importing annotations from various common element types, but by far not all. For more details about the supported element types, see the link:https://dkpro.github.io/dkpro-core/releases/2.2.0/docs/format-reference.html#format-Tei[DKPro Core TEI support] documentation.

When importing TEI files using this format, the XML structure of the document is **not** retained. When exporting an annotated document in this format, the XML structure is generated from scratch.

[[sect_formats_tei]]
= TEI P5 XML (experimental)

====
CAUTION: Experimental feature. To use this functionality, you need to enable it first by adding `format.tei.enabled=true` to the `settings.properties` file (see the <<admin-guide.adoc#sect_settings, Admin Guide>>).

The link:https://tei-c.org/guidelines/p5/[TEI P5 XML] format is a widely used standard format. It is a very complex format and furthermore is often extended for specific corpora.

When importing TEI files using this format, the XML structure of the document is retained. This allows {product-name} to render the document layout in HTML-based editors that support layout. However, TEI elements are **only** used for layout purposes. They do not become editable annotations in {product-name}.

To export an annotated TEI document, use e.g. <<sect_formats_uimaxmi,UIMA CAS XMI (XML 1.0)>> or <<sect_formats_uimajson,UIMA CAS JSON>>. The resulting exported files then contain the annotations as well as the entire TEI XML structure also in the form of annotations. They can be loaded and processed in Java using the link:https://github.com/apache/uima-uimaj#readme[Apache UIMA Java SDK] (both flavors) or in Python using link:https://pypi.org/project/dkpro-cassis/[DKPro Cassis] (only the XML 1.0 flavor).

It is not possible to export an annotated TEI document as TEI XML including the annotations.
