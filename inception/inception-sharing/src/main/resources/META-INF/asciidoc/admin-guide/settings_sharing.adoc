= Invite Links Settings

====
CAUTION: Experimental feature.
====

You can enable invite links for your {product-name} instance. This will allow project managers to 
generate invite links for their project which will expire automatically after one year or at a 
chosen date. They can also be deleted or regenerated by the manager. Any user of your instance can 
use this invite link to access the project. She will automatically be added to the project with 
annotator rights when following it. 

Optionally, users can be invited using a password-less login. In this mode, the user logging in 
simply chooses a login name and a project-bound password-less account for this user is created.
The user can only login to this account via the invite link. When the project is deleted, all the
project-bound accounts are deleted as well. The project-bound accounts internally use a randomized
user ID which allows projects projects with such accounts to be exported and imported into other
instances.
