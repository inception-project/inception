= Invite Links

Project managers can generate invite links to their projects which allow users to easily join their project. For this, visit the *Project Settings* and click on *Share Project*. Clicking on *Allow joining the project via a link* will generate the invite link that can then be copied and given to users (e.g. via email).

The user can now follow the invite link by entering it into a browser. She might be prompted to log into {product-name} and is then automatically added to the project with annotator rights and directed to the project dashboard page. She can now start annotating.

By default, users need to already have a {product-name} account to be able to use the link. However,
by activating the option *Allow guest annotators*, a person accessing the invite link can simply
enter any user ID they like and access the project using that ID. This ID is then valid only via the
invite link and only for the particular project. The ID is not protected by a password. When the
manager removes the project, the internal accounts backing the ID are automatically removed as well.

NOTE: This feature is not enabled by default. However, you can enable it by adding `sharing.invites.enabled=true` to the `settings.properties` file (see the <<admin-guide.adoc#sect_settings, Admin Guide>>).
