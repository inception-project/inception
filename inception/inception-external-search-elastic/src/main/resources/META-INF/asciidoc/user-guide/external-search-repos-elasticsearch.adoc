= ElasticSearch

Selecting the **ElasticSearch** repository type allows connecting to remote ElasticSearch instances.

In order to set up a connection to an ElasticSearch repository, the following information needs to
be provided:

* *Remote URL*: the URL where the ElasticSearch instance is running (e.g. `http://localhost:9200/`) 
* *Index Name*: the name of the index within the instance (e.g. `mycorpus`)
* *Search path*: the suffix used to access the searching endpoint (usually `_search`)
* *Object type*: the endpoint used to download the full document text (usually `texts`)
* *Field*: the field of the documents in the ElasticSearch repository that is used for matching
the search query (default `doc.text`)

From this information, two URLs are constructed:

* the search URL: `<URL>/<index name>/<search path>`
* the document retrieval URL as: `<URL>/<index name>/<object type>/<document id>`

NOTE: From the *remote URL* field, only the protocol, hostname and port information is used. Any 
      path information appearing after the port number is discarded and replaced by the index name and 
      search path as outlined above.

The individual documents should contain following two fields as their source:

* *doc*: should contain the subfield _text_ which is the full text of the document
* *metadata*: should contain subfields like _language_, _source_, _timestamp_ and _uri_
to provide further information about the document

The *Random Ordering* setting allows to switch the ranking of results from the default ranking used by
the ElasticSearch server to a random order. The documents returned will still match the query, but
the order does not correspond to the matching quality anymore. When random ordering is enabled, no
score is associated with the search results. If desired, the *random seed* used for the ordering
can be customized.

The *Result Size* setting allows to specify the number of document results that should be retrieved
when querying the document repository. The possible result sizes lie between 1 and 10000 documents.

If the default **Field** setting `doc.text` is used, then the JSON structure for indexed documents 
should look as follows:

[source,json]
----
{
  "metadata": {
    "language": "en",
    "source": "My favourite document collection",
    "timestamp": "2011/11/11 11:11",
    "uri": "http://the.internet.com/my/document/collection/document1.txt",
    "title": "Cool Document Title"
  },
  "doc": {
    "text": "This is a test document"
  }
}

== Setting up a simple ElasticSearch document repository

In this example, we use link:https://www.docker.com[Docker] to get ElasticSearch and link:https://elasticvue.com[ElasticVue] up and running very quickly. Note, that the docker containers we start
here will not save any data permanently. It is just for you to get an idea of how the setup works.
In a productive environment, you need to use a proper installation of ElasticSearch.

1. Open a terminal and run ElasticSearch as a Docker service
+
[source,sh]
----
$ docker run -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" -e "http.cors.enabled=true" -e "http.cors.allow-origin=http://localhost:9090" docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-oss:7.9.3-amd64
----
2. Open a second terminal and run ElasticVue as a Docker service
+
[source,sh]
----
$ docker run -p 9090:8080 cars10/elasticvue
----
3. Open a browser and access ElasticVue at `http://localhost:9090`
4. Switch to the Indices tab in ElasticVue
5. Create an index named "test"
6. Switch to the REST tab in ElasticVue
7. Set the HTTP Method to "POST" and enter `test/_doc/1` as the Path (means "create a new document with ID 1 in collection test)
8. Put the following JSON into the request body field
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "metadata": {
    "language": "en",
    "source": "My favourite document collection",
    "timestamp": "2011/11/11 11:11",
    "uri": "http://the.internet.com/my/document/collection/document1.txt",
    "title": "Cool Document Title"
  },
  "doc": {
    "text": "This is a test document"
  }
}
----
9. Click *Run Query*
10. Start up INCEpTION
11. Create a new project
12. Add a document repository with the following settings (and click save):
* Name: `My ElasticSearch Document Repository`
* Type: `Elastic Search`
* Remote URL: `http://localhost:9200`
* Index name: `test`
* Search path: `_search`
* Object type: `_doc`
* Field: `doc.text`
* Result Size: `1000`
* Random ordering: `false`
13. Switch to the *Dashboard* and from there to the *Search* page
14. Select the repository `test`
15. Enter `document` into the search field and press the *Search* button
16. You should get result for the document you posted to the ElasticSearch index in step 8
17. Click on *Import*
18. The import button should change to *Open* now - click on it to open the document in the annotation editor
