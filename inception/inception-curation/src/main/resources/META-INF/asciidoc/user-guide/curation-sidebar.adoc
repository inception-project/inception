= Curation Sidebar

====
CAUTION: Experimental feature. To use this functionality, you need to enable it first by adding `curation.sidebar.enabled=true` to the `settings.properties` file (see the <<admin-guide.adoc#sect_settings, Admin Guide>>).
====

Curation i.e. the process of combining finished annotated documents into a final curated document, can be done via the *Curation Page* in INCEpTION (see <<sect_curation, Curation>>) 
but also via the *Curation Sidebar* on the *Annotation Page*.

The sidebar allows the user to select the users whose annotations she wants to inspect 
and merge into the final document. Annotations from other users are shown above the user's annotations when
the user saves the user selection. 
The user can decide to *manually* or *automatically* merge their 
annotations into either her own document or a separate _Curation User Document_ as the final document.
The target document of the curated annotations can be configured in the sidebar's settings (cog-wheel icon).

The suggestions for manual curation can be stopped by _clearing_ all selected users and the user can return to their document if necessary via the settings cog-wheel.
Curation settings i.e. the selected users and the opened target document are cleared when leaving the annotation page but will be restored when opening the curation sidebar a next time. This way curation can be easily interrupted and picked up another time.

The user can always copy annotations *manually* from other users into the curation document by clicking on them.
The *automatic* merge can be triggered by clicking the *Re-Merge* button (sync icon). It will copy all annotations that 
all selected users agree on into the curation document.
