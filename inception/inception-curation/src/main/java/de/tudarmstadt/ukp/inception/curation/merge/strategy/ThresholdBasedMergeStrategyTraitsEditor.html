          Note that this setting only affects annotations on layers that allow stacking annotations. 
          For non-stacking other layers, an implicit setting of <code>1</code> is used here.<br>
          When set to <code>0</code>, all labels are merged.<br/>
          When set to <code>1</code>, only the single most-voted label is merged. If there is a tie on the most-voted 
          label, then nothing is merged.<br/>
          When set to <code>2</code> or higher, the respective <code>n</code> most-voted labels are pre-merged. 
          If there is any tie within the <code>n</code> most-voted labels, then all labels that still meet the lowest score of the tie are merged as well. <br/>
          For example, if set to <code>2</code> and three annotators voted for label <code>X</code> and another two anotators voted for <code>Y</code> and <code>Z</code>
          respectively, then <code>Y</code> and <code>Z</code> have a tie at the second rank, so both of them are merged.

          The confidence for a label is calculated by dividing the number of annotators that chose a given label
          by the number annotators that annotated a given position (<code>votes(label) / all_votes</code>). 
          The user threshold is applied before counting votes to calculate confidence. 
          The confidence interacts with the number of valid labels you expect. 
          E.g. if you expect that there could be four valid labels (and therefore set the top-voted 
          parameter to <code>4</code>), then the best confidence that a single label can have is <code>25%</code>
          (<code>= 100% / 4</code>).
