          When set to <code>1</code>, only the single most-voted label is merged. If there is a tie on the most-voted 
          label, then nothing is merged. When set to <code>2</code> or higher, the respective <code>n</code> most-voted 
          labels are pre-merged. If there is any tie within the <code>n</code> most-voted labels, then all labels that 
          still meet the lowest score of the tie are merged as well. For example, if set to <code>2</code> and three 
          annotators voted for label <code>X</code> and another two anotators voted for <code>Y</code> and <code>Z</code>
          respectively, then <code>Y</code> and <code>Z</code> have a tie at the second rank, so both of them are merged.
          Note that this setting only affects annotations on layers that allow stacking annotations. For other layers,
          an implicit setting of <code>1</code> is used here.

          The confidence for a label is calculated by counting the number of annotators that provided a given label
          dividing it by by the  the total number annotators that annotated a given 
          position (<code>votes(label) / all_votes</code>). The user threshold is applied before 
          counting votes to calculate confidence. The confidence interacts with the number of valid labels 
          you expect. E.g. if you expect that there could be four valid labels (and therefore set the top-voted 
          parameter to <code>4</code>), then the best confidence that a single label can have is <code>25%</code>
          (<code>= 100% / 4</code>).
