= Scheduler Settings

This section describes the global settings related to the scheduler.

.Number of threads
This parameter determines the number of threads the scheduler uses. It should be less than hardware
threads available on the machine that runs INCEpTION. The higher the number, the more tasks can be
run in parallel.

.Queue size
This parameter determines the maximum number of tasks that can be waiting in the scheduler queue. If
the queue is full, then no new tasks can be scheduled until running tasks are completed.

If no value for the parameter is specified, its default value is used. The default value is shown as
an example of how the parameter can be configured below:
