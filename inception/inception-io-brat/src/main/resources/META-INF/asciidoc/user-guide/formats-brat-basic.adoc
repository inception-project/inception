CAUTION: Experimental feature. To use this functionality, you need to enable it first by adding `format.brat-basic.enabled=true` to the `settings.properties` file (see the <<admin-guide.adoc#sect_settings, Admin Guide>>).
====

This format is the native format of the link:https://brat.nlplab.org[brat rapid annotation tool]. 
Its official documentation can be found link:https://brat.nlplab.org/standoff.html[here].

The **brat basic** format is mainly directed towards users who have existing texts annotated in the brat format and want to import these into {product-name}. In the brat format, a document always consists of two files: an `.ann` file containing the annotations and a `.txt` file containing the text. However, {product-name} requires every document to consist only of a single file. In order to import a document in **brat basic** format, it is therefore currently necessary to create one ZIP file per each pair of `.ann` and `.txt` file and then uploading this ZIP file into {product-name}. 

Before importing, ensure that your project contains the pre-defined layers **Basic span** and **Basic relation**. All annotations imported from the brat data will be mapped to these two layers. Also add any attributes that you want to import as features to the **Basic span** layer.
