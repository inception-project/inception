## Selecting a PDF Annotation Tool

There are only few requirements to a PDF annotation tool for integration into
_INCEpTION_.
It must provide support for span and relation annotations and
it should also be lightweight and easily modifiable to fit into _INCEpTION_.

There are two PDF annotation tools up for discussion.
The first one is https://github.com/paperai/pdfanno[_PDFAnno_] and the second
is https://github.com/hypothesis[_Hypothes.is_].
Both tools are web-based and open source software available on _GitHub_.

_PDFAnno_ is a lightweight annotation tool that only supports the PDF format.
It was created specifically to solve the lack of free open source software for
annotating PDF documents which is also capable of creating relations between
annotations. This is described in the publication about _PDFAnno_ by
https://aclweb.org/anthology/L18-1175[Shindo et al].

_Hypothes.is_ is a project that was created to provide an annotation layer
over the web. The idea is to be able to create annotations for all content
available in the internet and to share it with other people.
Hence _Hypothes.is_ provides the functionality to annotate PDF documents.

_PDFAnno_ compared to _Hypothes.is_ comes with a smaller code base and is less
complex.
Both editors feature span annotations, however only _PDFAnno_ provides the
functionality to create relations between span annotations which is required
in _INCEpTION_.
As _Hypothes.is_ was designed to share annotations with others a login mechanism
is part of the software.

_PDFAnno_ provides relations, is more lightweight and does not have a login
functionality, which would be removed.
Hence _PDFAnno_ fits the requirements better than _Hypothes.is_ and was
chosen as the PDF annotation tool for integration into _INCEpTION_.

## Differences in PDF Document Text Extractions

_PDFAnno_ uses https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/[PDF.js] to render PDF documents
in the browser.
The tool https://github.com/inception-project/pdfextract[_PDFExtract_] is used
to extract information about the PDF document text.
It produces a file in which each line contains information about one
character of the text.
Information includes the page, the character and the position coordinates of the
character in the PDF document, in the given order and separated by a tab character.
An example:

 1  E  0 1 2 3
 1  x  4 5 6 7
 1  a  8 9 10 11
 1  m  12 13 14 15
 1  p  16 17 18 19
 1  l  20 21 22 23
 1  e  24 25 26 27
 2  [MOVE_TO]  28 29
 2  NO_UNICODE  30 31 32 33

There are also draw operations included which are of no relevance for the use in
_INCEpTION_.
Characters which have no unicode mapping have the value `NO_UNICODE`.
The _PDFExtract_ file does not contain information about any whitespaces that
occur in the PDF document text.
_PDFAnno_ requires the PDF document and the _PDFExtract_ file to work.
The PDF document can be obtained from the _INCEpTION_ backend.
To also provide the _PDFExtract_ file, the tool was slightly modified so that it
can be used as a library in _INCEpTION_.

_PDFAnno_ provides an API for handling annotations.
It is possible to import a list of annotations by providing an URL for download.
This list has to be in the _TOML_ format.
Span annotations require the begin and end positions of the characters it covers.
This positions are equal to the line number of characters in the _PDFExtract_
file.
A span annotation example in TOML format:

 [[span]]
 id = "1"
 page = 1
 label = ""
 color = "#ff00ff"
 text = "Example"
 textrange = [1, 7]

The _Brat_ editor used in _INCEpTION_ works only on plain text.
For PDF documents this plain text is obtained by the use of _DKPro PDF Reader_.
The reader extracts the text information from the PDF document and performs
operations to ensure correct text ordering and to replace certain character
sequences with substitutes from a substitution table.

As the extractions between _PDFAnno_ and _INCEpTION_ differ a mapping of
those representations must be implement to ensure annotations can be exchanged
between the frontend and the backend and are usable across all editor modes.

## Preparing Representations

To use a mapping method between the text representation of _PDFAnno_ and
_INCEpTION_ at first they must be preprocessed to have a similar structure.

As the _PDFExtract_ file does not only contain the text string, first
the characters of the file need to be obtained and appended to a
string. All draw operations and `NO_UNICODE` lines are ignored.
As _DKPro PDF Reader_ uses a substitution table to sanitize the document text,
the same substitution table is used to sanitized the obtained string.

The _PDFExtract_ file does not contain any whitespaces present in the docment
text, however _DKPro PDF Reader_ preserves them.
The whitespaces are removed from the _DKPro PDF Reader_ string to have a similar
structure to the _PDFExtract_ sanitized string content.

Even though both representation now are in a similar shape it can still happen
that the content in both strings differs.
For example ordering of text areas could be messed up which can especially happen
for PDF documents that contain multiple text columns on one page.
As both representations are not equal even after preprocessing, a mapping algorithm
has to be implement to find the text of annotations from one representation in the
respective other representation.

## Mapping Annotations

There are multiple ways to achieve a mapping between _PDFAnno_ and _INCEpTION_ for
annotations. Two methods were tested during development: exact string search
with context and sequence alignment.

The first option is to make an exact search for the annotation text.
However as annotations often cover only one token an exact
search for the annotation text would result in multiple occurrences.
To get a unique result it is required to add context to the annotation text.
As this still can yield multiple occurrences, context is expanded until a unique
mapping or no mapping at all is found.
Performing this for all annotations results in a lot of string search operations.
However the performance can be improved by searching for all annotations in the
target string at once with the help of the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aho%E2%80%93Corasick_algorithm[Aho-Corasick] algorithm.

Another approach is to use sequence alignment methods which are popular in
bioinformatics.
PDF document texts are rather large and most sequence alignment algorithms
require O(M x N) memory space, where M and N are the size of the two sequences.
This results in a large memory consumption on computing the alignment, hence an
algorithm should be used that works with less memory.
Such an algorithm is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hirschberg%27s_algorithm[Hirschbergs algorithm].
It consumes only O(min(M,N)) memory.

The advantage of the sequence alignment method would be a direct mapping between
the representation of _PDFExtract_ and _DKPro PDF READER_.
However during testing for larger documents, for example 40 pages, the duration
until Hirschbergs algorithm finished was too long and would be unsatisfying for a user.
The exact string search however takes increasingly longer to compute mappings the
larger the document is and the more annotations have to be mapped.
As discussed the Aho-Corasick algorithm reduces the time however this still does not
scale well for larger documents.
To overcome this issue a page wise rendering of annotations was introduced.
When navigating through the PDF document in _PDFAnno_ annotations are rendered
dynamically per page.
In detail this means whenever the user moves through the document, the current
page changes and the user stops movement for 500 ms, the annotations for the
previous, current and next page are rendered.
This way large documents can be handled by the PDF editor without long wait times
for the user.

The exact string search seemed to perform well in terms of finding matching
occurrences for annotations in both directions.
For the manually tested documents all annotations were found and matched.
To evaluate the actual performance of the exact string search method an automated
test must be implemented that for example could create annotations for each token
in a document for a large document corpus.
This way a representative ratio of mapped and unmapped annotations could be
generated and unknown issues could be unveiled.
