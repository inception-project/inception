= Monitoring

NOTE: This functionality is only available to *curators* and *managers*.

This page shows the progress and document status of the current project and allows you to assign or block documents for users. 
Moreover, you are able to see the time of the last login of every user. After clicking on *Monitoring* on the Dashboard, 
the following page is displayed:

image::monitoring.png[align="center"]

The upper part of the page shows the overall progress of the project as the percental progress out of the workload for individual annotators 
and the number of finished documents.
The table below these statistics shows the document status of each document for each user via a symbol.

The following table explains the different possible symbols:

.Document Status
|===
| Symbol | Meaning

| image:icon_new.png[]
| Annotation has not started yet

| image:icon_locked.png[]
| Document not available to user

| image:icon_annotation_in_progress.png[]
| Annotation is in progress

| image:icon_done.png[]
| Annotation is complete

| image:icon_curation_in_progress.png[]
| Curation is in progress
|===

You can also alter the document status of annotators. By clicking on the symbols you can change between *Done* and *In Progress*.
You can also alter between *New* and *Locked* status. 
The second column of the document status frame displays the status of the curation. 

As there is only one curator for one document, curation is not divided into individual curators.
