= {product-name} User Guide
The {product-name} Team

== Introduction

This guide summarizes the functionality of {product-name} from the user's perspective.

NOTE: It is assumed that you plan to test the {product-name} standalone version or an already existing server installation of {product-name}. For information on how to set up {product-name} for a group of users on a server, please refer to the <<admin-guide.adoc#,Administrator Guide>>.

All materials, including this guide, are available via the link:{product-website-url}[{product-name} homepage].

== Workflow

The following image shows an exemplary workflow of an annotation project with {product-name}.

image::progress_workflow.jpg[align="center"]

First, the projects need to be set up. In more detail, this means that users are to be added, 
guidelines need to be provided, documents have to be uploaded, tagsets need to be defined and uploaded,
etc. The process of setting up and administrating a project are explicitly described in <<sect_projects>>.

After the setup of a project, the users who were assigned with the task of annotation annotate the
documents according to the guidelines. The task of annotation is further explained in <<sect_annotation>>.
The work of the annotators is managed and controlled by monitoring. Here, the person in charge has
to assign the workload. For example, in order to prevent redundant annotation, documents which are
already annotated by several other annotators and need not be annotated by another person, can be
blocked for others. The person in charge is also able to follow the progress of individual
annotators. All these tasks are demonstrated in <<sect_monitoring>> in more detail. The person in charge should not only control the quantity, but also the quality of annotation by looking closer into the
annotations of individual annotators. This can be done by logging in with the credentials of the
annotators.

After at least two annotators have finished the annotation of the same document by clicking on *Done*, the
curator can start his work. The curator compares the annotations and corrects them if needed. This
task is further explained in <<sect_curation>>. 

The document merged by the curator can be exported as soon as the curator clicked on *Done* for the
document. The extraction of curated documents is also explained in <<sect_projects>>.
