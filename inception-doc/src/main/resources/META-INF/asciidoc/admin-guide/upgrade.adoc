== Upgrade

=== Exporting/importing

* Log into WebAnno and export all the projects that you wish to migrate using the *Export* pane in the project settings
* Move your WebAnno home folder to a safe location so that WebAnno and create a new home folder in the old location
* Copy the *settings.properties* and *formats.properties* (if present) back from your moved folder
* Start the new WebAnno version to initialize the database
* Recreate the users
** If you are using MySQL
*** create a new database for the new WebAnno version and update the *settings.properties* accordingly
*** use link:http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysqldump.html[mysqldump] to dump the tables `users` and `authorities` from the old database and load it back into the new database
** If you are not using MySQL, you have to recreate the users manually
* When upgrading to WebAnno 2.x from a pre 2.x version, remove the *format.properties* file from the WebAnno home folder
* Restart WebAnno and import the previously exported projects

=== In-place update

This method should work when updating only a bugfix version, e.g. from 2.0.9 to 2.0.10. When performing a minor or major update, better use the exporting/importing method above.  

==== Backup your data

* Make a copy of your WebAnno home folder
* If you are using MySQL, make a backup of your WebAnno database, e.g. using the link:http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysqldump.html[mysqldump] command.

==== Standalone service
* Stop the WebAnno service
* Replace the `webanno.jar` file with the new version
* Ensure that the file has the right owner/group (usually `www-data`)
* Start the WebAnno service again

==== Separate Tomcat
* While Tomcat is running, delete the old WAR from your `webapps` folder
* Wait until Tomcat has automatically deleted the WebAnno folder 
* Stop Tomcat
* Place the new WAR file into your `webapps` folder
* Start Tomcat

=== Upgrading Tomcat 7 to Tomcat 8

If you have been using our installation instructions to install WebAnno on Linux, you are probably
running an instance of Tomcat 6. WebAnno 3.3.0 is no longer compatible with Tomcat 6 and requires
at least Tomcat 8. 

To upgrade your existing instance, you can try the following procedure (adapt the procedure as
necessary if you have deviated from our installation instructions):

    * Stop the current WebAnno Tomcat 7 instance
----
$ service webanno stop
----
    * Move your old Tomcat instance out of the way
----
$ mv /opt/webanno /opt/webanno-tomcat7
----
    * Install `tomcat8-user` package (this will automatically uninstall Tomcat 7)
----
$ apt-get install tomcat8-user
----
   * Create new instance
----
$ cd /opt
$ tomcat8-instance-create -p 18080 -c 18005 webanno
$ chown -R www-data /opt/webanno
----
  * Copy the WAR file over to the new instance
----
$ mv /opt/webanno-tomcat7/webapps/webanno.war /opt/webanno/webapps/webanno.war
----
    * Stop the new WebAnno Tomcat 8 instance
----
$ service webanno start
----
  
NOTE: If you have made additional changes to the Tomcat 7 configuration files, e.g. changed
      `conf/server.xml`, please make sure to redo them in the new Tomcat 8 instance.
