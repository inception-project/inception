=== Configure database via environment variables

The database connection details can also be configured via environment variables. When these
environment variables are present, they are preferred over the `settings.properties` file. 
The following environment variables can be used:

=== Custom header icons

It is possible to add custom icons to the page header. You can declare such custom icons in the application settings file as shown in the example below. Each declaration begins with the prefix `style.header.icon.` followed by an identifier (here `myOrganization` and `mySupport`). The suffixes `.linkUrl` and `.imageUrl` indicate the URL of the target page and of the icon image respectively. Images are automatically resized via CSS. However, to keep loading times low, you should point to a reasonably small image.

The order of the icons is controlled by the ID, not by the order in the configuration file!

.Example: Custom header icon
----
style.header.icon.myOrganization.linkUrl=http://my.org
style.header.icon.myOrganization.imageUrl=http://my.org/logo.png
style.header.icon.mySupport.linkUrl=http://my.org/support
style.header.icon.mySupport.imageUrl=http://my.org/help.png
----

=== Internal backups

Annotations are internally stored as files. Whenever a user performs an action on a
document, the file is updated. It is possible to keep automatic internal backups of
these files, e.g. to safeguard against crashes or bugs. 

The internal backups are controlled through three properties:

[cols="3*", options="header"]
|===
| Setting
| Description
| Default

| backup.interval
| Time between backups (seconds)
| `0` _(disabled)_

| backup.keep.number
| Maximum number of backups to keep
| `0` _(unlimited)_

| backup.keep.time
| Maximum age of backups to keep (seconds)
| `0` _(unlimited)_
|===

By default, backups are disabled (**backup.interval** is set to `0`). Changing this properties to
any positive number enables internal backups. The interval controls the minimum time between changes
to a document that needs to have elapsed in order for a new backup to be created.

When backups are enabled, either or both of the properties **backup.keep.number** and 
**backup.keep.time** should be changed as well, because their default values will cause the
backups to be stored indefinitely and they will eventually fill up the disk.

The properties **backup.keep.number** and **backup.keep.time** control how long backups are keep
and the maximal number of backups to keep. These settings are effective simultaneously.

.Example: Make backups every 5 minutes and keep 10 backups irrespective of age
----
backup.interval    = 300
backup.keep.number = 10
backup.keep.time   = 0
----

.Example: Make backups every 5 minutes and all not older than 7 days (60 * 60 * 24 * 7 seconds)
----
backup.interval    = 300
backup.keep.number = 0
backup.keep.time   = 604800
----

.Example: Make backups every 5 minutes and keep at most 10 backups that are not older than 7 days
----
backup.interval    = 300
backup.keep.number = 10
backup.keep.time   = 604800
----

=== External pre-authentication

It is possible to use the application with header-based external pre-authentication. In this mode,
the application looks for a special HTTP header (by default `remote_user`) and if that header exists, 
it is taken for granted that this user has been authenticated. It will check its internal
database if a user by the given name exists, otherwise it will create the user.

Pre-authentication can be enabled by setting the property `auth.mode` to `preauth`. When enabling
pre-authentication mode, the default roles for new users can be controlled using the 
`auth.preauth.newuser.roles` property. The `ROLE_USER` is always added, even if not specified
explicitly. Adding also the role `ROLE_PROJECT_CREATOR` allows all auto-created users also to
create their own projects. 

Since the default administrator user is not created in pre-authentication, it is useful to also
declare at least one user as an administrator. This is done through the property 
`auth.user.<username>.roles` where `<username>` must be replaced with the name of the user.
The example below shows how the user *Franz* is given administrator permissions. 

.Example: Authenticate using the `remote_user` header, new users can create projects, user *Franz* is always admin.
----
auth.mode                     = preauth
auth.preauth.header.principal = remote_user
auth.preauth.newuser.roles    = ROLE_PROJECT_CREATOR
auth.user.Franz.roles         = ROLE_ADMIN
----

NOTE: The roles specified through `auth.preauth.newuser.roles` are saved in the database when a
      user logs in for the first time and can be changed after creation through the user interface.
      
NOTE: The roles added through `auth.user.<username>.roles` properties are *not* saved in the
      database and *cannot* be edited through the user interface.
