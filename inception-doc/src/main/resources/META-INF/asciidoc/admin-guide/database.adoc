== Database

{product-name} uses an SQL database to store project and user data. 

We test MySQL using a MySQL server. {product-name} uses by default an embedded HSQLDB database. However, we 
recommend using the embedded database only for testing purposes. For production use, we recommend
using a MySQL server. The reason for this is, that:

* we do more testing on the MySQL server and
* in the past, we had cases where we described in-place upgrade procedures that required performing
  SQL commands to change the data model as part of the upgrade. We promise to try avoiding this in
  the future. However, in case we offer advice on fixing anything directly in the database, this
  advice will refer to a MySQL database.

We try to keep the data model simple, so there should be no significant requirements to the database
being used. Theoretically, it should be possible to use any JDBC-compatible database after adding a
corresponding driver to the classpath and configuring {product-name} to use the driver in the
`settings.properties` file.

If you plan to use UTF-8 encoding for project name and tagset/tag name, make sure either of the following settings for MySQL databse
a) in the `settings.properties` file, make sure that  `database.url` includes 

----
useUnicode=true&characterEncoding=UTF-8
----

b) change the `my.conf` MySQL databse configuration file to include the following line

----
character-set-server = utf8
----

=== Using HSQLDB in production

{product-name} displays a warning in the user interface when an embedded database is being used. In case
that you really want to run {product-name} with an embedded database in production, you probably want to
disable this warning. To do so, please add the following entry to the `settings.properties` file:

----
warnings.embeddedDatabase=false
----
