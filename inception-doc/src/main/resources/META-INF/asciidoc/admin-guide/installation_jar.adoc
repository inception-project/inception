= Running via embedded Tomcat (JAR)

The {product-name} standalone JAR with an embedded Tomcat server and can be easily set up as a 
UNIX service. This is the recommended way of running {product-name} on a server. 

The instructions below expect a Debian Linux system. Details may vary on other OSes and Linux
distributions.

== Installing as a service

To set it up as a service, you can do the following steps. For the following
example, I assume that you install {product-name} in `/srv/inception`:

* Copy the standalone JAR file `inception-app-standalone-{revnumber}.jar` to `/srv/inception/inception.jar`.
   Note the change of the filename to `inception.jar`.
* Create the file `/srv/inception/inception.conf` with the following content
+
[source,text]
----
JAVA_OPTS="-Djava.awt.headless=true -Dinception.home=/srv/inception"
----
+
* In the previous step, you have already created the `/srv/inception/settings.properties` file. 
  You *may optionally* configure the Tomcat port using the following line
+
[source,text]
----
server.port=18080
----
+
If you need to do additional configurations of the embedded Tomcat, best refer to the 
documentation of Spring Boot itself.
+
* Make sure that the file `/srv/inception/inception.conf` is owned by the root user. If this is
  not the case, {product-name} will ignore it and any settings made there will not have any effect. If
  you start {product-name} and intead of using the MySQL database, it is using an embedded database,
  then you should double-check that `/srv/inception/inception.conf` is owned by the root user.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ chown root:root /srv/inception/inception.conf
----
+
* Change the owner/group of `/srv/inception/inception.jar` to `www-data`. When the service is started,
  it will run with the privileges of the user that owns the JAR file, i.e. in this case {product-name}
  will run as under the `www-data` user. **Do NOT run {product-name} as root.**
+
[source,bash]
----
$ chown www-data:www-data /srv/inception/inception.jar
----
+
* Make the JAR file executable:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ chmod +x /srv/inception/inception.jar
----
+
* Create a symlink from `/etc/init.d` to the `/srv/inception/inception.jar`:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ln -s /srv/inception/inception.jar /etc/init.d/inception
----
+
* Enable the {product-name} service using
+
[source,bash]
----
$ systemctl enable inception
----
+
* Start {product-name} using
+
[source,bash]
----
$ service inception start
----
+
* Check the log output
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cat /var/log/inception.log
----
+
* Stop {product-name} using
+
[source,bash]
----
$ service inception stop
----

== Running the standalone behind HTTPD

These are *optional* instructions if you want to run {product-name} behind an Apache web-server instead
of accessing it directly. This assumes that you already have the following packages installed:

* Apache Web Server
* mod_proxy
* mod_proxy_ajp

* Add the following lines to `/srv/inception/settings.properties`:
+
[source,text]
----
tomcat.ajp.port=18009
server.servlet.context-path=/inception
server.use-forward-headers=true
----
+
* Edit `/etc/apache2/conf.d/inception.local.conf`
+
[source,xml]
----
ProxyPreserveHost On

<Proxy ajp://localhost/inception >
  Order Deny,Allow
  Deny from none
  Allow from all
</Proxy>

<Location /inception >
  ProxyPass ajp://localhost:18009/inception timeout=1200
  ProxyPassReverse http://localhost/inception
</Location>
----
* Restart Apache web server
+
[source,bash]
----
$ service apache2 restart
----
