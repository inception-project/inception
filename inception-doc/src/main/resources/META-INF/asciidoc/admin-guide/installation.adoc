== Installation

=== Prerequisites

* This guide assumes Debian 9.1 (Stretch). It may also work on Ubuntu with some modifications, but we do not test this. Instructions for other Linux distributions likely deviate significantly.
* It is further assumed that the user "www-data" already exists on the system and that it shall be used to run WebAnno.
* All commands assume that you are logged in as the *root* user. 

NOTE: If you cannot log in as root but have to use `sudo` to become root, then the recommended way to do that is using the command `sudo su -`.

=== Install Java 8

You can install an Oracle Java 8 JDK using the following commands.

[source,bash]
----
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install dirmngr
$ echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu trusty main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/webupd8team-java.list
$ echo "deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/webupd8team/java/ubuntu trusty main" | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/webupd8team-java.list
$ apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys EEA14886
$ apt-get update
$ apt-get install oracle-java8-installer
$ apt-get install oracle-java8-set-default
----

=== Prepare database

For production use of WebAnno, it is highly recommended to use a MySQL database. In this section,
we briefly describe how to install a MySQL server and how to prepare it for use with WebAnno.

* Install MySQL
+
[source,bash]
----
$ apt-get install mysql-server
----
* make sure your MySQL server is configured for UTF-8. Check the following line is present in `/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf` (this is specific to Debian 9; on other systems the relevant file
may be `/etc/mysql/my.cnf`):
+
[source,bash]
----
character-set-server = utf8
collation-server     = utf8_bin
----
* also ensure the default settings for client connections to are UTF-8 in `/etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf` (again Debian 9; likely in `/etc/mysql/my.cnf` on other systems)
+
[source,bash]
----
default-character-set = utf8
----
* login to MySQL
+
[source,bash]
----
$ mysql -u root -p
----
* create a database
+
[source,mysql]
----
mysql> CREATE DATABASE webanno DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin ;
----
* create a database user called `webanno` with the password `t0t4llYSecreT` which is later used by the application to access the database (instructions for `settings.properties` file below).
+
[source,mysql]
----
mysql> CREATE USER 'webanno'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 't0t4llYSecreT';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON webanno.* TO 'webanno'@'localhost';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
----

IMPORTANT: For production use, make sure you choose a different, secret, and secure password.

=== Setting up the WebAnno home folder

The WebAnno home folder is the place where WebAnno's configuration file `settings.properties`
resides and where WebAnno stores its data. Mind that if you are using a MySQL database server
(recommended), then WebAnno also stores some data in the MySQL database. This is important when
you plan to perform a backup, as both the home folder and the database content need to be
included in the backup.

Now, let's go through the steps of setting up a home folder for WebAnno and creating a
configuration file instructing WebAnno to access the previously prepared MySQL database.

* Create WebAnno home folder. This is the directory where WebAnno settings files and projects (documents, annotations, etc.) are stored
+
[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir /srv/webanno
----
////
// FIXME How to reference to sample data?
* *Optional* If you want to test WebAnno with some sample data, skip the _Users and permissions_ section and follow the instruction at [Sampledata], then come back here.
////
* Edit `/srv/webanno/settings.properties` to define the database connection as well as internal backup properties:
+
[source,text]
----
database.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQL5InnoDBDialect
database.driver=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
database.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/webanno?useSSL=false
database.username=webanno
database.password=t0t4llYSecreT

# 60 * 60 * 24 * 30 = 30 days
backup.keep.time=1000000

# 60 * 5 = 5 minutes
backup.interval=1000

backup.keep.number=10

ui.brat.sentences.number = 5
----
+
* Fix permissions in WebAnno home folder
+
[source,bash]
----
$ chown -R www-data /srv/webanno
----

=== Running via embedded Tomcat

The WebAnno standalone JAR with an embedded Tomcat server and can be easily set up as a 
UNIX service. This is the recommended way of running WebAnno on a server.

==== Installing WebAnno as a service

To set it up as a service, you can do the following steps. For the following
example, I assume that you install WebAnno in `/srv/webanno`:

* Copy the standalone JAR file +webanno-standalone-{revnumber}.jar+ to `/srv/webanno/webanno.jar`.
   Note the change of the filename to `webanno.jar`.
* Create the file `/srv/webanno/webanno.conf` with the following content
+
[source,text]
----
JAVA_OPTS="-Djava.awt.headless=true -Dwebanno.home=/srv/webanno"
----
+
* In the previous step, you have already created the `/srv/webanno/settings.properties` file. 
  You *may optionally* configure the Tomcat port using the following line
+
[source,text]
----
server.port=18080
----
+
If you need to do additional configurations of the embedded Tomcat, best refer to the 
documentation of Spring Boot itself.
+
* Make sure that the file `/srv/webanno/webanno.conf` is owned by the root user. If this is
  not the case, WebAnno will ignore it and any settings made there will not have any effect. If
  you start WebAnno and intead of using the MySQL database, it is using an embedded database,
  then you should double-check that `/srv/webanno/webanno.conf` is owned by the root user.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ chown root:root /srv/webanno/webanno.conf
----
+
* Change the owner/group of `/srv/webanno/webanno.jar` to `www-data`. When the service is started,
  it will run with the privileges of the user that owns the JAR file, i.e. in this case WebAnno
  will run as under the `www-data` user.
+
[source,bash]
----
$ chown www-data:www-data /srv/webanno/webanno.jar
----
+
* Create a symlink from `/etc/init.d` to the `/srv/webanno/webanno.jar`:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ln -s /srv/webanno/webanno.jar /etc/init.d/webanno
----
+
* Start WebAnno using
+
[source,bash]
----
$ service webanno start
----
+
* Stop WebAnno using
+
[source,bash]
----
$ service webanno stop
----

==== Running the standalone behind HTTPD

These are *optional* instructions if you want to run WebAnno behind an Apache web-server instead
of accessing it directly. This assumes that you already have the following packages installed:

* Apache Web Server
* mod_proxy
* mod_proxy_ajp

* Add the following lines to `/srv/webanno/settings.properties`:
+
[source,text]
----
tomcat.ajp.port=18009
server.contextPath=/webanno
server.use-forward-headers=true
----
+
* Edit `/etc/apache2/conf.d/webanno.local.conf`
+
[source,xml]
----
ProxyPreserveHost On

<Proxy ajp://localhost/webanno >
  Order Deny,Allow
  Deny from none
  Allow from all
</Proxy>

<Location /webanno >
  ProxyPass ajp://localhost:18009/webanno timeout=1200
  ProxyPassReverse http://localhost/webanno
</Location>
----
* Restart Apache web server
+
[source,bash]
----
$ service apache2 restart
----

=== Running via separate Tomcat

Instead of using the WebAnno standalone JAR (recommended) which comes with an embedded Tomcat,
you can also  deploy the WebAnno WAR archive into a separately installed Tomcat instance. 

==== Installing Tomcat

* Install package to install user-instances of Tomcat. 
+
[source,bash]
----
$ apt-get install tomcat8-user authbind
----
* Create new instance
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cd /opt
$ tomcat8-instance-create -p 18080 -c 18005 webanno
$ chown -R www-data /opt/webanno
----

NOTE: If WebAnno is the only application you install on your server, then you can also have WebAnno running on port 80 or port 443. In that case, substitute all instances of port `18080` in these
guidelines with the respective port. Mind that running via SSL on port 443 requires additional steps that we have not yet documented. Ports lower than 1024 are privileged and the WebAnno init script will automatically use a tool called *authbind* to allow WebAnno to operate on these ports as the unprivileged www-data user.

* Configure the startup script. Edit `/etc/init.d/webanno` and add the following contents or just download the file from link:admin-guide/scripts/webanno[here] and place it in `/etc/init.d`.
+
[source,bash]
----
include::scripts/webanno[]
----
* Make the script executable and register it to run during system start:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ chmod +x /etc/init.d/webanno
$ update-rc.d webanno defaults
----

NOTE: If you deploy WebAnno on a Linux machine that is short on entropy, you can significantly 
      decrease startup time by adding `-Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/urandom` to the `JAVA_OPTS`
      variable in the init script.

Now we have a dedicated Apache Tomcat instance for WebAnno installed at `/opt/webanno/` that automatically starts when the system boots and that can be managed through the usual `service` commands.

==== Deploying the WAR file

* Place the WebAnno WAR into the Tomcat `webapps` folder:
+
[source,bash,subs="+attributes"]
----
$ cp webanno-webapp-{revnumber}.war /opt/webanno/webapps/webanno.war
----
+
NOTE: Mind that the copy command above renames the WAR file to `webanno.war`! This is important so that WebAnno is accessible at the URL noted later in the present guidelines.
* Start WebAnno
+
[source,bash]
----
$ service webanno start
----
* Open it with your browser at `http://localhost:18080/webanno`. If you chose to run WebAnno behind the Apache web-server use `http://localhost/webanno`.
The first time, it will create a username `admin` with password `admin`. Log in with this username and proceed.

==== Running the WAR behind Apache HTTPD

These are *optional* instructions if you want to run WebAnno behind an Apache web-server instead
of accessing it directly. This assumes that you already have the following packages installed:

* Apache Web Server
* mod_proxy
* mod_proxy_ajp

* Edit `/opt/webanno/conf/server.xml` and enable AJP Connector on localhost (comment in, add address, and change port
+
[source,xml]
----
<Connector port="18009" protocol="AJP/1.3" redirectPort="8443" address="127.0.0.1"/>
----
* Disable HTTP Connector (just comment it out)
+
[source,xml]
----
<!--Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1".
           connectionTimeout="20000".
           URIEncoding="UTF-8"
           redirectPort="8443" /-->
----
* Edit `/etc/apache2/conf.d/webanno.local.conf`
+
[source,xml]
----
ProxyPreserveHost On

<Proxy ajp://localhost/webanno >
  Order Deny,Allow
  Deny from none
  Allow from all
</Proxy>

<Location /webanno >
  ProxyPass ajp://localhost:18009/webanno timeout=1200
  ProxyPassReverse http://localhost/webanno
</Location>
----
* Restart Apache web server
+
[source,bash]
----
$ service apache2 restart
----
